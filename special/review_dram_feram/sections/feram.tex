The discovery of robust ferroelectricity in doped HfO2 films enabled FeRAM and FeFET \cite{boscke2011,mueller2012}. FeFET cells provide 1T bit storage with non-volatility and fast reads; FeRAM capacitors offer low-voltage writes. Challenges include polarization variability, endurance in the 10^{12}â€“10^{13} range, and TDDB under high fields; recent work addresses device physics and integration routes toward memory and compute-in-memory.
