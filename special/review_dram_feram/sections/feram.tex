HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics enabled FeRAM and FeFET devices with back-end-of-line friendly integration \cite{boscke2011,mueller2012}. FeRAM cells provide non-volatility with fast switching suitable for embedded applications, while FeFETs map the ferroelectric state into a field-effect threshold shift that can be read at low energy \cite{noheda2023}.

Key device topics include polarization variability, wake-up and fatigue behavior, retention, imprint, and reliability under scaled fields. On the integration side, process compatibility with advanced CMOS and cycling-induced degradation need careful management. Literature reports endurance in the $10^{12}$--$10^{13}$ cycle range and retention exceeding $10^5$ s for optimized stacks, with write energy typically above DRAM writes on a per-bit basis \cite{noheda2023,martin2020}.
