The discovery of robust ferroelectricity in doped HfO$_2$ films enabled FeRAM and FeFET
with CMOS-friendly back-end integration~\cite{boscke2011,mueller2012}. Device-level challenges
include polarization variability, endurance dispersion, and high-field reliability concerns
(e.g., TDDB). System-wise, FeRAM/FeFET provide non-volatility with fast writes and low-voltage
operation, making them attractive complements to DRAM~\cite{noheda2023,martin2020}.
