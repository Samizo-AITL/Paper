The discovery of robust ferroelectricity in doped HfO2 films \cite{boscke2011,mueller2012} enabled FeRAM and FeFET devices compatible with advanced CMOS back-end processes. Key challenges include polarization variability, fatigue and endurance, retention at scaled dimensions, and time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB). Recent reviews outline device physics and integration paths toward memory and logic-in-memory use \cite{noheda2023}.

FeFET cells provide 1T bit storage with non-volatility and fast reads, and FeRAM capacitor cells can deliver low read energy with high endurance. Typical endurance of \mbox{$10^{12}$--$10^{13}$} cycles and retention exceeding \mbox{$10^{5}$ s} have been reported, while write energy per bit is generally higher than DRAM.
