DRAM will continue to dominate volatile working memory due to speed, density, and ecosystem maturity. HfO2-based FeRAM/FeFET offers a CMOS-compatible non-volatile complement with fast access, though variability, endurance dispersion, and integration limits remain active topics \cite{noheda2023,martin2020}. Hybrid hierarchies that pair DRAM for hot data with FeRAM for persistence can reduce refresh energy while enabling fast recovery paths.

Looking ahead, co-design across devices, controllers, and operating systems will be central: retention-aware placement, telemetry-driven reliability management, and low-latency persistence paths are promising directions to broaden deployment from embedded and edge to selected data-centric systems.
