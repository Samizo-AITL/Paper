DRAM will continue to dominate volatile working memory due to speed, density, and maturity \cite{choi2022,kim2021_dram}. FeRAM based on HfO$_2$ offers a compelling non-volatile complement with CMOS compatibility and competitive access latency, albeit with variability and integration challenges \cite{noheda2023}. Hybrid designs that pair DRAM for hot data with FeRAM for persistence can cut refresh energy and enable fast recovery paths. Future work that bridges device improvements with controller and OS support will determine how broadly ferroelectric memories augment or, in niche cases, replace DRAM for embedded and edge scenarios.
