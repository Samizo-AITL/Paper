DRAM will continue to dominate volatile working memory due to its speed, density, and maturity. FeRAM provides a compelling non-volatile complement with CMOS compatibility and competitive access latency, although endurance variability and integration limits remain active topics. Hybrid hierarchies that combine DRAM and FeRAM can reduce refresh energy while providing fast persistence. Future work should bridge device-level progress with controller and OS mechanisms for retention-aware placement and reliability management.
