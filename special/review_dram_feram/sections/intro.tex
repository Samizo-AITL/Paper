Memory hierarchies are central to computing systems. 
DRAM remains the dominant volatile memory due to speed, density, and scalability \cite{choi2022,kim2021_dram}. 
However, DRAM scaling faces limits as capacitors shrink; 3D DRAM concepts are explored to extend scaling \cite{iedm2023_dram}.

In parallel, doped HfO$_2$ ferroelectrics enabled FeRAM and FeFET with CMOS-friendly integration \cite{boscke2011,mueller2012}. 
These offer non-volatility with fast switching but face polarization variability, endurance, and TDDB concerns. 

This review contrasts DRAM and FeRAM at device and system levels and outlines hybrid use-cases. 
As an overview, Figs.~\ref{fig:speed_retention} and \ref{fig:energy_speed} conceptually illustrate the trade-offs in access speed, retention, and write energy, which will be detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:comparison}.
