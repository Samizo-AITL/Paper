DRAM scaling progressed via high-k dielectrics and either deep-trench or stacked capacitors.
Maintaining sufficient cell capacitance while suppressing leakage below deep sub-20 nm nodes is
challenging~\cite{choi2022}. To extend scaling, 3D stacking and array layering are explored, though
integration complexity and refresh overhead remain open concerns~\cite{iedm2023_dram}.

From a metrics viewpoint, DRAM provides sub-10 ns access, very low energy/bit for reads and writes,
and effectively unlimited endurance (refresh-limited). Retention is short and necessitates periodic
refresh~\cite{kim2021_dram}.
