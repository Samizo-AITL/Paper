DRAM scaling progressed via high-k dielectrics and deep trench or stacked capacitors. Maintaining sufficient capacitance while limiting leakage below deep sub-20 nm nodes is challenging \cite{choi2022}. 3D DRAM concepts (capacitor stacking and array layering) are explored to extend density, but integration complexity and refresh energy remain concerns \cite{kim2021_dram,iedm2023_dram}.

From a metric viewpoint, DRAM provides sub-\si{\nano\second} to tens of \si{\nano\second} access with very high endurance (effectively refresh-limited), very low energy per bit for reads/writes, but short retention that necessitates periodic refresh.
