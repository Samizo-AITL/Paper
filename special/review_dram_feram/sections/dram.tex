DRAM scaling progressed via high-k dielectrics and deep trench or stacked capacitors. Maintaining capacitance while limiting leakage below deep sub-20 nm nodes is challenging \cite{choi2022}. 3D stacking and array layering are investigated to extend density \cite{kim2021_dram,iedm2023_dram}.

From a metrics view, DRAM provides sub-10 ns access, very low energy/bit for reads and writes, and effectively unlimited endurance (refresh-limited). Retention is short and necessitates periodic refresh.
