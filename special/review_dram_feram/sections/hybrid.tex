Hybrid memory hierarchies aim to combine DRAM performance with FeRAM persistence.
By placing FeRAM near the controller or adjacent to DRAM, systems can reduce refresh
energy, enable instant-on features, and accelerate checkpointing and recovery
for critical state.

\subsection*{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduced refresh overhead: cold pages and metadata can reside in FeRAM, cutting DRAM refresh traffic and standby power.
  \item Fast persistence: OS/app state can be checkpointed to FeRAM with $\mu$s–ms latency.
  \item Data resilience: FeRAM provides crash consistency for critical metadata and write-back buffers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Constraints and trade-offs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Endurance/variability: FeRAM endurance ($10^{12}$--$10^{13}$ cycles) is high but below effective DRAM activity.
  \item Write energy/latency: typically higher than DRAM; bias read-mostly or cold data to FeRAM.
  \item Integration cost: ferroelectric layer/FeFET adds process and reliability risks (e.g., high-field stress).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{System directions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Intensity/retention-aware placement and migration.
  \item Refresh co-optimization for DRAM regions shadowed/backed by FeRAM.
  \item Controller/OS support for wear tracking, retention-aware placement, and error telemetry.
\end{itemize}
