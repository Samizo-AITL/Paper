\section{Hybrid Perspectives and Future Memory Hierarchies}

Hybrid memory hierarchies aim to combine DRAM performance with FeRAM persistence. Benefits include reduced refresh energy, fast checkpointing, and resilience for critical metadata.

\textbf{Benefits:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduced refresh overhead by parking cold pages in FeRAM.
  \item Microsecond-scale persistence for OS/app state.
  \item Crash consistency for metadata and write-back buffers.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Constraints and trade-offs:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item FeRAM endurance is high but below DRAM refresh activity.
  \item Write energy/latency generally higher than DRAM.
  \item Integration and reliability risks in advanced nodes.
\end{itemize}
