\section{Hybrid Perspectives and Future Memory Hierarchies}

Hybrid memory hierarchies aim to combine the high capacity and speed of DRAM with the non-volatility and instant resume capability of FeRAM (including FeFET variants). 
By placing FeRAM near the memory controller or integrated as chiplets alongside DRAM, systems can reduce refresh energy, enable instant-on functionality, and support fast checkpointing and recovery.

\subsection*{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Reduced refresh overhead:} FeRAM can hold cold pages or metadata, cutting DRAM refresh traffic and standby power.
  \item \textbf{Fast persistence:} OS and application state can be checkpointed to FeRAM with microsecond-scale latency.
  \item \textbf{Data resilience:} FeRAM provides crash consistency for critical metadata and write-back buffers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Constraints and trade-offs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Endurance and variability:} FeRAM endurance ($10^{12}$--$10^{13}$ cycles) is high but below effective DRAM activity levels.
  \item \textbf{Write energy and latency:} Higher than DRAM; cold or read-mostly data should be placed in FeRAM.
  \item \textbf{Integration cost:} Ferroelectric layers or FeFET adoption adds process and reliability risks (e.g., high-field stress).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{System-level directions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Tiering policies:} Classify pages/objects by write intensity and retention needs, migrating cold or persistent data to FeRAM.
  \item \textbf{Refresh co-optimization:} Dynamically shrink DRAM refresh for regions shadowed or backed by FeRAM.
  \item \textbf{Controller/OS support:} Metadata for wear tracking, retention-aware placement, and error telemetry.
  \item \textbf{SystemDK co-design:} Enable holistic optimization from chiplets to OS in one design flow.
\end{itemize}
