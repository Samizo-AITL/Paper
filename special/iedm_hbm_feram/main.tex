% ===== Abstract =====
\begin{abstract}
High-bandwidth memory (HBM) provides the throughput required by mobile edge AI accelerators but suffers from high standby power due to refresh and volatility.
Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), based on HfO$_2$, offers non-volatility, low-voltage operation, and fast rewriting.
Monolithic integration of HBM and FeRAM was initially examined, but the process mismatch --- DRAM capacitor requiring $>$700$^\circ$C anneal versus FeRAM requiring $\sim$400$^\circ$C --- makes it infeasible.
Therefore, this work proposes \textbf{chiplet-based HBM+FeRAM integration} on a silicon interposer.
System-level analysis shows that FeRAM chiplets reduce standby power by suppressing DRAM refresh, enable instant resume, and enhance overall efficiency for mobile edge AI workloads.
