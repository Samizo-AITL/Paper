\section{Conclusion}
We evaluated the integration of HBM with FeRAM for mobile edge AI. 
Due to the thermal budget conflict between DRAM capacitors (high-$T$ anneals $>700^\circ$C) 
and HfO$_2$ ferroelectrics (low-$T$ stabilization $\sim400^\circ$C), 
monolithic integration is impractical.  

Therefore, chiplet-based integration emerges as the realistic and effective solution. 
By co-packaging HBM and FeRAM dies on a silicon interposer and enabling holistic optimization with \textit{SystemDK}, 
this architecture can deliver high bandwidth, substantially reduced standby power, 
instant resume after power gating, and sufficient endurance for checkpoint traffic.  

In conclusion, chiplet-based HBM+FeRAM integration provides a practical pathway for next-generation mobile edge AI, 
balancing bandwidth, non-volatility, and energy efficiency.
