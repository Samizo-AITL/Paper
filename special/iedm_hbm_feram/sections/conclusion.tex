\section{Conclusion}
We presented a roadmap from HBM+FeRAM chiplet integration (near-term) to HBM+FeFET monolithic integration (long-term). 
Chiplets offer practical standby power reduction and instant resume for mobile edge AI. 
Monolithic HBM+FeFET remains a compelling research target to achieve non-volatile, high-bandwidth memory in one stack.
