\section{Future Outlook: Toward HBM+FeFET}
In the near term, chiplet integration of HBM and FeRAM offers a practical solution for mobile edge AI, balancing bandwidth and persistence. 
Future prospects include replacing FeRAM with FeFET:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Non-destructive read}, reducing wear-out,
  \item \textbf{Higher density}, fitting within HBM logic base,
  \item \textbf{CMOS compatibility}, easing scaling to advanced nodes.
\end{itemize}

Nevertheless, true monolithic integration faces process conflicts: DRAM capacitors require high-$T$ anneals, while FeFETs demand low-$T$ stabilization. 
Overcoming this is an active research challenge.
