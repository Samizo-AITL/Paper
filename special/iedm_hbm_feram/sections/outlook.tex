\section{Future Outlook}
Our process evaluation indicates that \textbf{chiplet-based integration} of HBM and FeRAM/FeFET
is the most practical near-term approach. DRAM capacitors require high-temperature annealing ($>700^\circ$C)
for stable high-$k$ phases, whereas FeFETs demand low-temperature ferroelectric crystallization ($<400^\circ$C).
Reliability limits also diverge (leakage vs. wake-up/fatigue).

Thus, monolithic HBM+FeFET is not feasible today. However, \textbf{true monolithic integration}
remains an attractive long-term research challenge. Localized annealing, dopant modulation, or stress capping
may eventually allow DRAM and FeFET to coexist on the same wafer.
