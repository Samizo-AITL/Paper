\section{Future Outlook}
In the near term, chiplet integration of HBM and FeRAM offers a practical solution for mobile edge AI, 
balancing bandwidth and persistence. 
Future enhancements may explore replacing FeRAM with FeFET to further improve characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Non-destructive read}, reducing wear-out,
  \item \textbf{Higher density}, fitting within the HBM logic base,
  \item \textbf{CMOS compatibility}, easing scaling to advanced nodes.
\end{itemize}

Rather than pursuing monolithic integration, which faces fundamental process conflicts 
(high-$T$ anneals for DRAM capacitors vs. low-$T$ stabilization for FeFETs), 
the practical pathway is continued refinement of chiplet-based solutions. 
This includes tighter co-design across architecture, interfaces, and memory control policies using \textbf{SystemDK}, 
to maximize bandwidth efficiency, reduce standby power, and extend system-level scalability.
