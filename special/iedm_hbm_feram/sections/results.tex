\section{Results and Discussion}
System-level simulation was performed with representative AI inference workloads.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Standby Power}: $>$30\% reduction by migrating cold data to FeRAM-backed tier.
  \item \textbf{Resume Latency}: reduced to $\mu$sâ€“ms range, enabling instant resume across power cycles.
  \item \textbf{Endurance}: $10^{12}$ writes/year fits within FeRAM capability for checkpoint traffic.
\end{itemize}
