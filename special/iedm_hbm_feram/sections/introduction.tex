High-bandwidth memory (HBM) provides the throughput required by mobile edge AI accelerators but suffers from high standby power due to periodic refresh and volatility. 
Ferroelectric memories (FeRAM/FeFET), based on HfO$_2$, offer non-volatility and fast switching, though at higher energy cost. 
This work investigates hybrid integration of HBM and FeRAM/FeFET: a near-term solution based on chiplet co-packaging and a long-term direction toward monolithic integration. 
Results indicate that FeRAM can substantially reduce standby power and enable instant resume, while FeFET provides a pathway toward scalable, dense, non-volatile HBM.

\section{Introduction}
Mobile edge AI demands memory subsystems that simultaneously provide:
(1) multi-hundred GB/s bandwidth, 
(2) ultra-low standby power, 
(3) near-instant resume after power gating, and 
(4) sufficient endurance for frequent checkpoints.
HBM DRAM is effective for (1), but its reliance on periodic refresh causes significant standby power overhead and resume latency, which increasingly limit scalability \cite{ChoiIEDM2022,KimIEDM2021}.  

Ferroelectric memories based on HfO$_2$---including FeRAM and FeFET devices---naturally address (2) and (3), while exhibiting endurance of $10^{12}$â€“$10^{13}$ cycles \cite{MuellerIEDM2012,MartinVLSI2020}. 
Recent advances in HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics also demonstrate improved retention, reliability, and compatibility with advanced CMOS nodes \cite{NohedaNature2023}.  

This paper evaluates hybrid HBM+FeRAM/FeFET integration, with emphasis on practical chiplet-based co-packaging for near-term deployment, and an assessment of the challenges and opportunities of monolithic process integration for future high-density, non-volatile HBM.
