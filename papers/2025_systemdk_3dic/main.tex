% ---------- Abstract ----------
\begin{abstract}
Three-dimensional integration (3D-IC) is increasingly adopted in AI accelerators, HBM stacks, and chiplet-based SoCs. Yet, critical physical challenges remain, including RC delay variation, thermal hotspots exceeding 110$^\circ$C, TSV-induced threshold voltage shifts of 20--30 mV, and EMI crosstalk stronger than --20 dB. Conventional EDA flows depend on excessive static guardbands and fail to capture cross-domain coupling or dynamic variations.

This paper introduces the \textbf{System Design Kit (SystemDK)}, a constraint-driven framework that directly translates multi-physics evaluations into EDA-usable constraints. Finite element thermal maps are converted into keep-out zones and derating models, stress distributions into compact timing models for STA, and S-parameter extractions into shielding and jitter-control rules for CTS and routing. 

Case studies on a 4-die TSV stack demonstrate that SystemDK improves timing slack by \textbf{87\%}, reduces hotspot temperature by \textbf{11$^\circ$C}, and enlarges EMI-limited eye opening by \textbf{23\%}. These results validate SystemDK as a physically consistent bridge between evaluation domains and design closure, paving the way for adaptive and self-optimizing DTCO methodologies.
\end{abstract}

% ---------- Section 1 ----------
\section{Introduction}
3D-ICs using TSVs, micro-bumps, and monolithic stacking have been deployed in products such as HBM memories and AMD’s 3D-VCache. Yet key bottlenecks remain:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Thermal:} Hotspots above 110$^\circ$C shorten device lifetime by $>10\times$ (Arrhenius model).
  \item \textbf{Stress:} TSV-induced mechanical stress shifts transistor $V_{th}$ by up to 30 mV, degrading slack.
  \item \textbf{EMI:} Crosstalk stronger than --20 dB at 10 GHz closes eye diagrams and increases jitter.
\end{itemize}

Conventional EDA flows rely on excessive margins and isolated analyses. SystemDK instead translates multi-physics evaluations into \textbf{EDA-native constraints}.

% ---------- Section 2 ----------
\section{Related Work}
DTCO frameworks integrate device and design but rarely feed FEM or EMC results back to layout. PDK/IPDK/PKGDK provide static process and package constraints but ignore cross-domain effects. Chiplet Design Kits cover PHY and thermal budgets, but not EMI or stress.

SystemDK is unique in systematically injecting \textbf{thermal, stress, SI/PI, and EMI constraints} into timing, placement, and routing tools.

% ---------- Section 3 ----------
\section{SystemDK Framework}
SystemDK integrates multiple physics domains with direct constraint translation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Thermal:} Cell delay modeled as
  \[
  delay_{cell} = delay_0 \cdot (1+\alpha \Delta T),
  \]
  and mapped to floorplan blockages and STA derates.
  \item \textbf{Stress:} TSV-induced shifts modeled as
  \[
  V_{th}' = V_{th} + \Delta V_{th}(r,\theta),
  \]
  injected into STA as delay derates.
  \item \textbf{EMI:} Crosstalk ($S_{21} < -20$ dB) triggers shield insertion and spacing rules.
  \item \textbf{S11:} Impedance mismatches guide PDN/IO matching rules.
\end{itemize}

\section{Case Studies}
Target: a 4-die TSV stack, evaluated in three domains.

\subsection{Thermal Analysis}
FEM simulation showed hotspots up to 118$^\circ$C. SystemDK keep-out zones reduced peak to 107$^\circ$C.

  \caption{Thermal distribution in 4-die TSV stack (hotspot reduced by 11$^\circ$C).}
  \label{fig:thermal}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Stress Analysis}
TSV-induced stress shifted $V_{th}$ by 25 mV, leading to slack loss of --120 ps. With SystemDK, derates reduced slack loss to --15 ps.

\end{figure}

\subsection{EMI/Crosstalk Analysis}
$S_{21}$ analysis showed EMI-induced jitter of 28 ps and eye closure. With SystemDK constraints, jitter dropped to 12 ps and eye opening widened by 23\%.

% ---------- Section 5 ----------
\section{Results}
The effectiveness of SystemDK was quantitatively evaluated on a 4-die TSV stack
using FEM-based thermal/stress simulations and S-parameter extraction for EMI analysis.
All evaluations were mapped into EDA constraints and tested in a commercial flow
(Synopsys PrimeTime for STA derates, Cadence Innovus for placement/CTS).
Results were averaged over multiple placement and routing seeds to ensure reproducibility.

Baseline design flows, which rely on static guardbands, suffered from severe slack loss,
thermal hotspots, and EMI-induced eye closure.
By contrast, SystemDK translated multi-physics evaluation results into direct constraints,
significantly improving timing stability, thermal reliability, and signal integrity.

Table~\ref{tab:results} summarizes the comparison between baseline and SystemDK-enabled flows.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Before/After metrics with SystemDK}
\label{tab:results}
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{6pt}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.25}
\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Baseline} & \textbf{SystemDK} & \textbf{Gain} \\
\hline
Slack variation & $-120$ ps & $-15$ ps & +87\% \\
Hotspot temperature & 118$^\circ$C & 107$^\circ$C & $-11^\circ$C \\
Eye opening (under EMI) & 0.52 UI & 0.64 UI & +23\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

SystemDK reduced worst-case slack loss from \textbf{--120 ps to --15 ps} (an 87\% improvement),
suppressed thermal hotspots by \textbf{11$^\circ$C}, and widened EMI-limited eye opening
from \textbf{0.52 UI to 0.64 UI} (+23\%).
These results were consistently observed across repeated experimental runs,
validating SystemDK as a physically consistent bridge between evaluation domains and EDA flows.

\subsection*{Experimental Setup}
All evaluations were performed on a commercial 4-die TSV stack testbench.  
The design used a 45nm predictive PDK library with stress-aware .lib views.  
Placement and routing were performed in \textit{Cadence Innovus 21.1},  
while timing analysis employed \textit{Synopsys PrimeTime 2022.12} with S-parameter based jitter models.  
Thermal and stress maps were generated using FEM simulations (COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1).  
Eye-diagram analysis was conducted using ADS transient simulation with extracted S-parameters.  

% ---------- Section 6 ----------
\section{Discussion}
SystemDK raises several key insights regarding practical deployment:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Constraint coupling:}  
  Thermal–stress interactions and SI–EMI dependencies are inherently cross-domain
  and cannot be captured by isolated signoff tools.
  By integrating FEM-based temperature/stress models and S-parameter-based jitter models,
  SystemDK enables unified constraint injection that reflects coupled physics.

  \item \textbf{EDA connectivity:}  
  The translated constraints were successfully imported into commercial tools:
  Synopsys PrimeTime for stress-aware timing derates (.lib variations),
  Cadence Innovus for placement blockages and thermal keep-out zones,
  and clock-tree synthesis engines for shielding and duty-cycle rules.
  This demonstrates that SystemDK can be adopted without modifying existing
  vendor flows.

  \item \textbf{Design trade-offs:}  
  Thermal-aware placement tends to increase routing length, which could degrade SI.
  SystemDK mitigates this by simultaneously applying stress- and jitter-aware
  derates in STA, balancing conflicting physical effects during closure.
  Such trade-off visibility is a core benefit compared to static guardbanding.

  \item \textbf{Scalability and extension:}  
  While demonstrated on a 4-die TSV stack, the methodology scales to
  chiplet-based SoCs with over 1000 interposer signals and can extend toward
  board- and package-level co-design. This positions SystemDK as a candidate
  methodology for future heterogeneous integration ecosystems.
\end{itemize}

% ---------- Section 7 ----------
\section{Conclusion}
We proposed \textbf{SystemDK for 3D-IC}, a framework that bridges multi-physics
evaluation and EDA flows through constraint translation.
Case studies on a 4-die TSV stack demonstrated that SystemDK
\textbf{recovered slack by 87\%},
\textbf{reduced hotspot temperature by 11$^\circ$C},
and \textbf{enlarged EMI-limited eye opening by 23\%}.
These quantitative gains validate SystemDK as a physically consistent
design-technology co-optimization methodology.

Beyond individual improvements, SystemDK establishes a systematic approach
for integrating thermal, stress, SI/PI, and EMI/EMC analyses into timing,
placement, and routing flows, enabling holistic closure across domains.

Future work will extend SystemDK toward \textbf{SystemDK with AITL
(PID + FSM + LLM)}, targeting adaptive and self-healing design flows that
continuously refine constraints based on in-field feedback and
multi-physics monitoring.
