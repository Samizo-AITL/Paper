We documented a historical case where SCF and parallel margin lots enabled quick condition fixing and yield recovery from 65\% to 80\%. Wet-oriented resist stripping reduced plasma-damage accumulation, and stronger back-bias helped meet a 90~\si{\celsius} mobile requirement. The case remains educational for technology transfer and reliability engineering.
