We adopted Short-Cycle Feedback (SCF): quick loops of evaluation and condition tuning per unit process, with conditions tracked in the electronic traveler. Ten \emph{formal} lots (including margin conditions) were run to optimize settings, followed by three production lots for reliability and dedicated burn-in lots. Margin lots swept NMOS/PMOS $V_{\mathrm{th}}$ (H/L/Typ) and gate-length bounds to verify the design window reproducibility.
