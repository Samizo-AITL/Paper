Parallel margin lots efficiently confirmed the process window under mass-line conditions, avoiding delays from strictly serial confirmation. Retention behavior is framed by $\tau = C_{\mathrm{cell}} V_{\mathrm{cell}} / I_{\mathrm{leak}}$, highlighting sensitivity to junction and dielectric leakage. The disturb-refresh behavior connects conceptually to modern row-disturb/row-hammer phenomena. We discuss portability of this ramp-up template to technology transfers beyond DRAM.
