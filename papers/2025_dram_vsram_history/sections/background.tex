We summarize cell/circuit features of the 0.25-\textmu m 64-Mbit DRAM (stack capacitor, divided word-line, WSi stacks), and the wafer-test binning (Bin1--Bin7). For VSRAM, SRAM-like access is achieved by internal refresh logic while keeping DRAM cells; mobile-grade operation extended the temperature guarantee from 80~\si{\celsius} to 90~\si{\celsius}.
