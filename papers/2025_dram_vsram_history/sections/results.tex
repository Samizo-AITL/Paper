\section{Results}

The initial yield was approximately 65\%, with pause-refresh errors being the dominant failure mode (Bin-5). 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and process tracing indicated that cumulative plasma damage during resist ashing after WSA-ET and multiple LDD steps was the primary cause. 
By adopting a wet-oriented resist strip to minimize plasma exposure and reinforcing the body back-bias (e.g., from $-1$~V to $-3$~V), the yield improved to around 80\%, successfully meeting long-term reliability requirements. 
Figure~\ref{fig:yield} illustrates the lot-by-lot yield recovery.
