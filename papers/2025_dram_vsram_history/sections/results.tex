The initial yield was about 65\%, with pause-refresh errors dominating (Bin-5). SEM and process tracing suggested cumulative plasma damage due to resist ashing after WSA-ET and multiple LDD steps. Switching to a wet-oriented resist strip minimized plasma exposure; together with strengthened body back-bias (e.g., from $-1$~V to $-3$~V), yield improved to about 80\% and passed long-term reliability. Figure~\ref{fig:yield} shows the lot-by-lot yield recovery.
