\section{Results}

The initial yield was about 65\%, with pause-refresh errors dominating (Bin-5).
SEM and process tracing suggested cumulative plasma damage due to resist ashing after WSA-ET and multiple LDD steps.
Switching to a wet-oriented resist strip minimized plasma exposure; together with strengthened body back-bias (e.g., from $-1$~V to $-3$~V), yield improved to about 80\% and passed long-term reliability.
Figure~\ref{fig:yield} shows the lot-by-lot yield recovery.
