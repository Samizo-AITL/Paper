This paper revisits a historical ramp-up (1998--2001) where a 0.25-\textmu m 64-Mbit DRAM line was prepared for mass production and later reused for a mobile pseudo-SRAM (VSRAM). We outline the industrial context, objectives, and contributions: (i) a concise SCF-based ramp-up recipe with parallel margin lots, (ii) a case analysis of retention-mode failures, and (iii) a practical improvement that enabled yield recovery and high-temperature operation.
