\begin{abstract}
Conventional medical ultrasonic devices have been dominated by PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$) \cite{akata2009pzt}. 
However, Pb-containing materials face strict regulatory restrictions (EU RoHS, REACH, FDA) in in-body medical applications. 
This work proposes a Pb-free alternative based on ScAlN MEMS arrays, integrated with 65 nm SiGe CMOS using System-in-Package (SiP) technology.

The ScAlN MEMS array is designed for 10--50 MHz operation with $\lambda/2$ pitch for high-resolution imaging \cite{akrout2018scaln}. 
The SiGe CMOS front-end integrates LNA, VGA, and ADC, enabling detection of microvolt-level signals. 
The SiP approach ensures yield separation, short interconnects, and hermetic sealing for medical reliability.

Finite element and circuit simulations demonstrate: adequate sensitivity and beam directivity at 20--40 MHz, 
noise reduction with SiGe LNA (NF < 2 dB), and compact, reliable packaging via flip-chip SiP.

Conclusion: Pb-free ScAlN MEMS arrays, combined with 65 nm SiGe CMOS via SiP, represent a practical solution for next-generation 
high-resolution medical ultrasound sensors, with strong competitiveness in ophthalmology, vascular imaging, dermatology, and implantable applications.

\section{Introduction}
Medical ultrasonic imaging is widely used in ophthalmology, vascular diagnosis, dermatology, and implantable monitoring. 
Traditional devices have been dominated by PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$) because of its superior piezoelectric properties \cite{akata2009pzt}. 
However, Pb toxicity has become a limitation for in-body use due to EU RoHS, REACH, and FDA regulations.

Scandium-doped Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN) has emerged as a Pb-free candidate due to CMOS compatibility, high-Q properties, 
and industrial adoption in RF BAW/XBAR filters \cite{akrout2018scaln}. 
This paper proposes ScAlN MEMS arrays co-integrated with 65 nm SiGe CMOS front-ends via SiP for medical ultrasound.

\section{System Concept}
\subsection{ScAlN MEMS Array}
The array operates at 10--50 MHz, with 64--256 channels designed under the $\lambda/2$ pitch rule. 
Structures include PMUT-like stacks or BAW/XBAR cavities.

\subsection{SiGe CMOS Front-end}
65 nm SiGe BiCMOS provides low NF (< 2 dB). 
It integrates LNA, VGA, ADC, and T/R switch, optimized for microvolt-level signals.

\subsection{System-in-Package Integration}
Flip-chip bonding enables MEMS and CMOS die integration. 
Benefits: yield separation, short interconnects, hermetic sealing.

\section{Simulation Results}
FEM analysis confirms resonant frequencies at 20, 30, 40 MHz with $k^2_{eff} = 2$--4\%. 
Circuit simulations show LNA input noise < 2 nV/$\sqrt{Hz}$ and system SNR > 60 dB at 20--40 MHz.

\section{Application Scenarios}
- Ophthalmology: 20--40 MHz anterior eye imaging \cite{pavlin2009ubm}.  
- Vascular IVUS: 30--40 MHz catheter arrays \cite{foster2000ivus}.  
- Dermatology: 10--20 MHz skin/tumor imaging.  
- Implantables: miniaturized SiP with telemetry.

\section{Discussion}
Compared with PZT, ScAlN offers CMOS compatibility and Pb-free compliance at the cost of lower $d_{33}$.  
Compared with CMUT/PMUT \cite{khuri2009cmut}, ScAlN requires lower bias and offers better reliability in fluids.  
SiP provides yield separation, short interconnects, and hermetic reliability versus monolithic integration.

\section{Conclusion}
Pb-free ScAlN MEMS arrays integrated with 65 nm SiGe CMOS via SiP provide:  
- Regulatory compliance and safety,  
- Adequate resolution at 20--50 MHz,  
- Low-noise detection via SiGe CMOS,  
- Scalable, reliable SiP packaging.  

This makes the approach a practical and competitive solution for next-generation medical ultrasonic sensors.
