## Abstract

Conventional medical ultrasonic devices have been dominated by **PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)Oâ‚ƒ)**.  
However, Pb-containing materials face **strict regulatory restrictions (EU RoHS, REACH, FDA)** in in-body medical applications.  
This work proposes a **Pb-free alternative** based on **ScAlN MEMS arrays**, integrated with **65 nm SiGe CMOS** using **System-in-Package (SiP)** technology.

The **ScAlN MEMS array** is designed for **10â€“50 MHz operation** with Î»/2 pitch for high-resolution imaging.  
The **SiGe CMOS front-end** integrates **LNA, VGA, and ADC**, enabling detection of microvolt-level signals.  
The **SiP approach** ensures yield separation, short interconnects, and hermetic sealing for medical reliability.

Preliminary finite element and circuit simulations demonstrate:  
- Adequate sensitivity and beam directivity at 20â€“40 MHz  
- Low-noise performance with SiGe LNA (NF < 2 dB equivalent)  
- Miniaturization and reliability with flip-chip SiP integration  

**Conclusion:** Pb-free ScAlN MEMS arrays, combined with 65 nm SiGe CMOS via SiP, represent a **practical solution for next-generation high-resolution medical ultrasound sensors**, with strong competitiveness in ophthalmology, vascular imaging, dermatology, and implantable monitoring applications.
