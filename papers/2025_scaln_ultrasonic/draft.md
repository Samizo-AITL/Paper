# Introduction

Medical ultrasonic imaging is widely used in **ophthalmology, vascular diagnosis, dermatology, and implantable monitoring**.  
Traditional devices have been dominated by **PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)Oâ‚ƒ)** because of its superior piezoelectric properties.  
However, the **toxicity of Pb** has become a serious limitation for **in-body medical applications**, as regulated by **EU RoHS, REACH, and FDA**.  

As a result, there is an urgent demand for **Pb-free alternatives** that can provide comparable performance while ensuring **biocompatibility and regulatory compliance**.  
Several materials have been investigated, including KNN, BNT, ZnO, and PVDF.  
Among these, **Scandium-doped Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN)** has emerged as the **most promising candidate** due to its:  

- Compatibility with **CMOS processes** (low deposition temperature, sputtering)  
- **High Q** and suitable piezoelectric properties for **RF and ultrasonic frequencies**  
- Demonstrated industrial adoption in **RF BAW/XBAR filters**  

This work proposes a **Pb-free ScAlN MEMS ultrasonic array**, co-integrated with a **65 nm SiGe CMOS front-end** via **System-in-Package (SiP)** technology, as a practical solution for next-generation medical ultrasound sensors.

# Discussion

## Comparison with PZT
- **PZT**: High dâ‚ƒâ‚ƒ (100â€“500 pC/N), but Pb toxicity and incompatibility with CMOS.  
- **ScAlN**: Lower dâ‚ƒâ‚ƒ (20â€“30 pC/N), but CMOS-compatible, Pb-free, and proven in RF applications.  
- For high-frequency arrays (20â€“50 MHz), **ScAlNâ€™s lower coupling is less limiting**, while Pb-free compliance is decisive.  

## Comparison with CMUT/PMUT
- **CMUT**: High frequency potential but requires high bias voltage, reliability concerns in liquid media.  
- **PMUT (PZT-based)**: Pb contamination risk in medical devices.  
- **ScAlN MEMS**: Low-voltage drive, CMOS-compatible, and safer for body-contact devices.  

## Advantages of SiP vs Monolithic Integration
- SiP allows **independent MEMS and CMOS fabrication**, maximizing yield.  
- Flip-chip integration provides **short interconnects** comparable to monolithic approaches.  
- Hermetic SiP packaging ensures **medical-grade reliability**, with scalable production.
