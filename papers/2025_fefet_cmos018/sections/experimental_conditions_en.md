\section{Experimental Conditions}
Ferroelectric gate stacks were prepared with the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ thickness: 10\,nm (ALD deposition).
  \item Capacitor area: $100 \times 100$\,$\mu$m$^2$.
  \item Gate voltage: $\pm 3$\,V, pulse width 1\,\si{\micro\second}--1\,ms.
  \item Measurement frequency: 1\,kHz--1\,MHz.
  \item Equipment: Keysight B1500A semiconductor analyzer with Cascade probe station.
\end{itemize}
