FeFETs based on HfZrO\textsubscript{x} thin films have emerged as a CMOS-compatible option for embedded non-volatile memory (NVM)~\citep{boscke2011hafnium, mueller2012fefet}. Such devices combine scalability with low-power operation, but practical deployment requires integration within mature logic processes~\citep{schenk2019review} widely used in automotive and IoT.

In this work, we target a legacy 0.18\,\si{\micro\meter} CMOS logic flow and demonstrate a minimal-overhead integration of FeFET modules.

\textbf{This paper makes the following contributions:}
(i) demonstration of a drop-in FeFET module fully compatible with the baseline logic flow,
(ii) realization with only one additional mask step, minimizing process cost, and
(iii) quantitative evaluation of the reliability window, covering both endurance and retention metrics~\citep{mueller2015endurance, park2020nbdoping}.

Program and erase operations are realized by switching between opposite polarization states ($\pm P_r$) stored in the ferroelectric gate.
