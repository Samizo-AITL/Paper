FeFETs based on HfZrO\textsubscript{x} thin films have emerged as a CMOS-compatible option for embedded non-volatile memory (NVM)~\citep{Mulaosmanovic2017}. Such devices combine scalability with low-power operation, but their practical deployment requires proven integration within mature logic processes widely used in cost- and reliability-driven markets such as automotive and IoT.  

In this work, we target a legacy 0.18\,\si{\micro\meter} CMOS logic flow and demonstrate a minimal-overhead integration of FeFET modules.  

\textbf{The key contributions of this paper are as follows:}  
1) demonstration of a drop-in FeFET module fully compatible with the baseline logic flow,  
2) realization with only one additional mask step, minimizing process cost, and  
3) quantitative evaluation of the reliability window, covering both endurance and retention metrics.  

Program and erase operations are achieved by switching between opposite polarization states ($\pm P_r$) stored in the ferroelectric gate, enabling embedded NVM functionality within standard CMOS.
