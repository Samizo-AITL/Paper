FeFETs based on HfZrO\textsubscript{x} thin films provide a CMOS-compatible option for embedded non-volatile memory (NVM)~\citep{Mulaosmanovic2017}. In this work, we focus on integration within a legacy 0.18\,\si{\micro\meter} logic process, which remains widely adopted in automotive and IoT applications.  

\textbf{This paper makes the following contributions:}  
(i) demonstration of a drop-in FeFET module compatible with the baseline logic flow,  
(ii) realization with minimal additional mask steps, and  
(iii) quantitative assessment of the reliability window, including retention and endurance.  

Program and erase operations are realized by switching between opposite polarization states ($\pm P_r$) stored in the ferroelectric gate.  

\paragraph*{Related Work} A broad survey of FeFET integration and reliability challenges can be found in~\citep{Khan2015}.
