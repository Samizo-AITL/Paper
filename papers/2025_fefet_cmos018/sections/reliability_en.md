\subsection*{Endurance}
Program/erase (P/E) cycling up to $10^{5}$ operations exhibits less than 20\% degradation in the threshold voltage window $\Delta V_\mathrm{th}$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:endurance}.

\subsection*{Retention}
Retention was projected for 10 years at $85^\circ$C based on an Arrhenius activation model with activation energy $E_a=\cdots$, following the method in \citep{Yamazaki2018}.
