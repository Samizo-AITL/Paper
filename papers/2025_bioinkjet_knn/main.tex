% ===== Abstract =====
\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a biocompatible inkjet printing architecture based on
lead-free piezoelectric materials, specifically bulk KNN (K,Na)NbO$_3$,
combined with chip-on-film (COF) driver IC implementation and silicon
cavity integration.
While Pb-free piezoelectrics have failed to replace PZT in industrial
printing due to strict requirements on performance, endurance, and cost,
bioprinting applications impose more moderate demands.
Typical needs include droplet volumes of 1--10~\si{\pico\liter}, device
lifetimes on the order of $10^6$ shots, and operation within $\pm
50$~\si{\volt}, all of which can be met by KNN-based actuators.
We present the process flow, expected performance, and potential
applications in bio-3D printing, cell patterning, and protein
microarrays.
