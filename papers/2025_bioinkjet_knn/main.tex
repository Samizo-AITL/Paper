% ===== Abstract =====
\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a biocompatible inkjet printing architecture based on
lead-free piezoelectric actuators, specifically bulk KNN (K,Na)NbO$_3$, combined
with chip-on-film (COF) driver ICs, silicon cavity integration, and
an AITL (Adaptive Intelligent Three-Layer) supervisory control framework.
Unlike conventional PZT-driven industrial heads, the KNN approach supports
biocompatibility and Pb-free compliance, while moderate performance
(3--5 pL droplets, $10^6$ shots, $\pm50$ V operation) satisfies bioprinting needs.
Beyond actuation, the electromechanical response of KNN is leveraged for
\emph{self-diagnosis}: detecting missing droplets and estimating ink viscosity.
This diagnostic data feeds into an AITL architecture---an inner PID loop for
real-time stability, an FSM layer for mode transitions and compensation,
and an LLM-driven supervisory layer for adaptive redesign of control rules.
We present the architecture, process flow, and representative biomedical
applications, highlighting the potential of KNN as both actuator and sensor.
