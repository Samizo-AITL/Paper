\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes a bio-compatible inkjet architecture based on
lead-free piezoelectric materials, specifically bulk KNN (K,Na)NbO$_3$,
combined with COF driver IC implementation and Si cavity integration.
While Pb-free piezoelectrics failed to replace PZT in industrial
printing due to performance and durability demands, in bio-printing
applications the requirements are more moderate: droplet volumes of
1--10 pL, endurance around $10^6$ shots, and voltages within $\pm50$ V
are sufficient. We present a process flow, expected performance, and
potential applications in bio 3D printing, cell patterning, and
protein microarrays.
