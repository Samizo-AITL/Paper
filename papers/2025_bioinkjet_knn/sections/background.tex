\section{Background: Pb-free Piezoelectrics}
Pb-free piezoelectrics such as KNN, BNT, and ScAlN have been studied
for over two decades.
KNN exhibits $d_{33}$ of 150--250 pm/V and a Curie temperature above
400~Â°C, making it a candidate for moderate-displacement actuators.
ScAlN, though lower in strain, offers CMOS compatibility and MEMS
integration potential.
Previous industrial trials failed mainly because the requirement was
\textit{full PZT compatibility}, which is not necessary for bio-use.
