\section{Proposed Architecture}
The proposed Bio-IJ actuator system consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bulk KNN multilayer stack actuator (200--500 µm thick).
  \item COF driver IC (16--32 ch, ±50 V, waveform RAM).
  \item Si cavity and nozzle integration (φ8 µm, 3--5 pL droplets).
  \item Reservoir and back pressure control (−2.0 kPa, PID stabilized).
  \item PI membrane damper for pressure fluctuation suppression.
\end{itemize}

The process flow includes stack fabrication, electrode finishing,
terminal cutting, COF assembly, heat spreader bonding, and Si cavity
bonding.
