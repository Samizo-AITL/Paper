The associated \textit{process flow} begins with fabrication of the bulk
KNN stack and electrode finishing, followed by terminal cutting and COF
assembly. The actuator is then mounted with a heat spreader for thermal
management and finally bonded to the silicon cavity structure,
resulting in an integrated Bio-IJ printhead module.

  The design integrates a bulk KNN multilayer actuator, COF driver IC,
  silicon cavity/nozzle array, and fluidic components (reservoir with
  PI damper and back-pressure control).}
