\section{Introduction}
Inkjet printing technology has been widely adopted in industrial and
consumer applications, largely based on PZT actuators.
However, lead-free alternatives such as KNN and BNT failed to gain
traction due to insufficient PZT compatibility in terms of $d_{33}$,
durability, and cost.
In contrast, bio-printing applications impose different requirements:
biocompatibility and moderate performance are prioritized over extreme
durability.
This paper explores a bulk KNN-based Bio-Inkjet (Bio-IJ) architecture
to address these needs.
