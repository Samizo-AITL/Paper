\section{Applications}
Potential applications include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cell patterning}: deposition of living cells with survival rates above 80\%.
  \item \textbf{Protein microarrays}: picoliter deposition of antibodies or DNA spots.
  \item \textbf{Hydrogel 3D printing}: pL-scale deposition followed by UV or thermal curing.
\end{itemize}

The moderate performance of KNN actuators is sufficient for these
applications, where droplet volume control and biocompatibility are
more critical than long-term durability.
