\section{Conclusion}
This work positions bulk KNN actuators as a viable basis for
lead-free Bio-Inkjet systems.
Unlike industrial printing, bio-printing does not require full PZT
compatibility; moderate $d_{33}$ and endurance are sufficient.
The proposed architecture---bulk KNN stacks, COF driver IC, and Si
cavity integration---can deliver pL droplets reliably while meeting
biocompatibility demands.
This opens a path for standardization of Pb-free Bio-IJ in research,
clinical, and educational contexts.
