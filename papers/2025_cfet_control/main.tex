\begin{abstract}
Gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet FETs can be designed under static assumptions, where parasitics and thermal effects are treated as fixed values. However, complementary FETs (CFETs) with stacked n/p channels suffer from strong vertical self-heating and stress coupling. These effects vary dynamically, leading to RC delay shifts that static design cannot capture. This paper introduces a time-response-aware design paradigm: proportional--integral--derivative (PID) feedback regulates delay deviation, finite-state machine (FSM) guards ensure safety under hotspots, and large language model (LLM) supervision adapts controller gains under workload drift. Simulations of compact RC--thermal--stress networks in SystemDK demonstrate more than two orders of magnitude suppression of delay deviation, reducing peak error from $\sim$8\% to $2.6\times 10^{-3}$ and steady-state error below $10^{-6}$. This reframes CFET optimization from static prediction to dynamic compensation, addressing self-heating and stress-induced variability in sub-2\,nm integration.

\section{Introduction}
Until the GAA generation, device and circuit design could rely on static analysis: resistance, capacitance, and temperature rise were treated as fixed values. However, as we move to CFET integration, where nFET and pFET are vertically stacked, two challenges dominate: (1) \emph{self-heating}, where the top tier's heat propagates to the bottom tier, raising resistance and delay; and (2) \emph{stress coupling}, where vertical stacking and thermal expansion generate asymmetric strain, modulating threshold voltage and carrier mobility. Both effects are strongly time-dependent and interact with RC delay.

Conventional static design optimizes for a snapshot condition, but fails to account for how delay, temperature, and stress evolve over time. This limitation motivates a new paradigm: \emph{time-response-aware design}, where stability and convergence under dynamic workloads become first-class design targets. We incorporate control theory---PID feedback, FSM guards, and LLM supervision---to stabilize delay and temperature in CFET stacks. Unlike prior studies that only modeled parasitics~\cite{yakimets2020cfet,irds2023}, we demonstrate runtime compensation.

\section{Problem Statement: Self-Heating and Stress Challenges}
CFET integration introduces coupled physical phenomena that cannot be captured by static assumptions:  

1) \textbf{Self-heating:} Power dissipated in the top tier propagates downward, increasing the temperature of the lower tier. The rise in temperature increases via resistance, causing time-varying RC delay.  

2) \textbf{Stress coupling:} Vertical stacking and thermal expansion induce asymmetric mechanical stress. This stress alters threshold voltage and carrier mobility, leading to delay variability.  

3) \textbf{Static design limitations:} Traditional methods provide only a snapshot at fixed conditions. In CFETs, delay dynamically shifts due to coupled thermal and stress effects, which static optimization cannot predict or compensate.  

Therefore, CFET requires a time-response-aware design methodology.

\section{Modeling}
We integrate RC delay, thermal dynamics, and stress coupling into a unified model.  

\subsection{Baseline Delay}
The baseline delay, defined as the propagation delay when one gate drives another of equal size, is given by:
\[
T_{delay} = (R_{wire} + R_{via})(C_{load} + C_{inter}).
\]

\subsection{Thermal Dynamics}
Resistance grows with temperature:
\[
R(T) = R_0 \left(1 + \alpha (T - T_{ref}) \right).
\]
Temperature follows a first-order thermal RC network:
\[
C_{th}\frac{dT}{dt} = P\cdot R_{th} - (T - T_{amb}).
\]

\subsection{Stress Coupling}
Thermo-mechanical stress reduces carrier mobility:
\[
\mu_{eff} = \mu_0 (1 - \gamma \sigma_{eff}),
\]
where $\sigma_{eff}$ is proportional to temperature rise $\Delta T$. Delay therefore couples to both $T$ and $\sigma$.

\section{Control Architecture}
We propose a three-layer architecture:  

1) \textbf{PID controller:} Regulates delay deviation $\varepsilon_d$ via DVFS actuation $u$, ensuring convergence and reducing steady-state error.  

2) \textbf{FSM guard:} Enforces HOT mode when $T_{top}>85^\circ$C, bounding $u\leq u_{max}$ to prevent runaway control effort.  

3) \textbf{LLM supervisor:} Monitors time-series of delay and temperature, retuning $(K_p,K_i,K_d)$ and FSM thresholds when overshoot or oscillation exceed tolerance.  

Together, these layers provide stability (PID), safety (FSM), and adaptability (LLM).

\section{Experimental Setup}
Simulations were performed using SystemDK 2025 with discrete step size $dt=1$ ns and horizon 1.5 s, capturing both burst transients and long-term convergence.  

\subsection{Parameters}
- Via resistance $R_{via} = 1$--10 $\Omega$  
- Inter-tier capacitance $C_{inter} = 1$--5 fF  
- Burst power $P_{burst} = 0.1$--1.0 W  
- Coupling factor $k_c = 0.3$--0.9  
- Stress coefficient $\gamma = 0.05$--0.2  

Thermal RC constants were extracted from compact models. PID initial gains were set via Zieglerâ€“Nichols tuning, FSM threshold was fixed at $T_{top}=85^\circ$C, and LLM adaptation updated gains dynamically.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Without Control}
Burst heating increased delay deviation up to $\sim$8\%. Stress coupling further degraded mobility, amplifying delay shifts. Static design could not mitigate these variations.  

\subsection{PID Only}
PID suppressed error magnitude by over 10$\times$, but overshoot remained during transients.  

\subsection{PID + FSM}
The FSM clamped actuation under hotspots, preventing runaway. However, fixed thresholds limited flexibility across workloads.  

\subsection{PID + FSM + LLM (Proposed)}
With LLM adaptation, delay deviation smoothly converged under all conditions. Peak error was reduced to $2.6 \times 10^{-3}$, and steady-state error fell below $10^{-6}$. Stability was maintained across $\gamma=0.05$--0.2.

\end{table}

\section{Stability Analysis}
The closed-loop transfer function is
\[
T(s) = \frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)}, \quad L(s)=C(s)G(s).
\]
PID gains were chosen to ensure phase margin $>45^\circ$ and gain margin $>6$ dB. FSM bounded actuation during thermal runaway. LLM maintained stability margins as $\{k_c,\gamma,P\}$ drifted, ensuring convergence and safety across variations.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}
\subsection{Significance}
The proposed methodology shifts CFET design from static optimization to dynamic compensation. Delay error was reduced by more than 100$\times$, robust across heating and stress variations.  

\subsection{Comparison with Static Design}
Static design captures only a snapshot, ignoring time evolution. Our method incorporates temporal dynamics, using the converged steady state as a design target.  

\subsection{Limitations}
- Compact-model abstraction omits full 3D parasitics.  
- Process variation and noise remain unmodeled.  
- LLM supervision was simulated; hardware realization may require lightweight approximations.  

\subsection{Future Work}
- Chip-in-loop validation with test silicon.  
- Extension to forksheet and sequential 3D CFET.  
- Integration with microfluidic cooling and NoC traffic control for co-optimization.  

\section{Conclusion}
We proposed a time-response-aware design for CFETs, addressing both self-heating and stress coupling. By integrating PID, FSM, and LLM into the design methodology, delay and thermal behavior were stabilized under dynamic workloads. This reframes CFET design from static prediction to dynamic compensation, and establishes time-response-aware design as an essential methodology for sub-2 nm integration.
