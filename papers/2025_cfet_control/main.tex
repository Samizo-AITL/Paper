\begin{abstract}
Gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet FETs can be designed under static assumptions, where parasitics and thermal effects are treated as fixed values. However, complementary FETs (CFETs) with stacked n/p channels suffer from strong vertical self-heating and stress coupling. These effects vary dynamically, leading to RC delay shifts that static design cannot capture. This paper introduces a time-response-aware design paradigm: proportional--integral--derivative (PID) feedback regulates delay deviation, finite-state machine (FSM) guards ensure safety under hotspots, and large language model (LLM) supervision adapts controller gains under workload drift. Simulations of compact RC--thermal--stress networks in SystemDK demonstrate more than two orders of magnitude suppression of delay deviation, reducing peak error from $\sim$8\% to $2.6\times 10^{-3}$ and steady-state error below $10^{-6}$. This reframes CFET optimization from static prediction to dynamic compensation, addressing self-heating and stress-induced variability in sub-2\,nm integration.

\section{Introduction}
Until the GAA generation, device and circuit design could rely on static analysis: resistance, capacitance, and temperature rise were treated as fixed values. However, as we move to CFET integration, where nFET and pFET are vertically stacked, two challenges dominate: (1) \emph{self-heating}, where the top tier's heat propagates to the bottom tier, raising resistance and delay; and (2) \emph{stress coupling}, where vertical stacking and thermal expansion generate asymmetric strain, modulating threshold voltage and carrier mobility. Both effects are strongly time-dependent and interact with RC delay.

Conventional static design optimizes for a snapshot condition, but fails to account for how delay, temperature, and stress evolve over time. This limitation motivates a new paradigm: \emph{time-response-aware design}, where stability and convergence under dynamic workloads become first-class design targets. We incorporate control theory---PID feedback, FSM guards, and LLM supervision---to stabilize delay and temperature in CFET stacks. Unlike prior studies that only modeled parasitics~\cite{yakimets2020cfet,irds2023}, we demonstrate runtime compensation. Classical control theory references such as Franklin~\cite{franklin2015feedback}, Khalil~\cite{khalil2002nonlinear}, and Anderson~\cite{anderson2007optimal} form the analytical backbone of this work.

\section{Problem Statement: Self-Heating and Stress Challenges}
CFET integration introduces coupled physical phenomena that cannot be captured by static assumptions:  
1) \textbf{Self-heating:} Power dissipated in the top tier propagates downward, increasing the temperature of the lower tier. The rise in temperature increases via resistance, causing time-varying RC delay.  
2) \textbf{Stress coupling:} Vertical stacking and thermal expansion induce asymmetric mechanical stress. This stress alters threshold voltage and carrier mobility, leading to delay variability.  
3) \textbf{Static design limitations:} Traditional methods provide only a snapshot at fixed conditions. In CFETs, delay dynamically shifts due to coupled thermal and stress effects, which static optimization cannot predict or compensate.  
Therefore, CFET requires a time-response-aware design methodology.

\section{Modeling}
We integrate RC delay, thermal dynamics, and stress coupling into a unified model.  
\subsection{Baseline Delay}
\[
T_{delay} = (R_{wire} + R_{via})(C_{load} + C_{inter}).
\]
\subsection{Thermal Dynamics}
\[
R(T) = R_0 \left(1 + \alpha (T - T_{ref}) \right), \quad
C_{th}\frac{dT}{dt} = P\cdot R_{th} - (T - T_{amb}).
\]
\subsection{Stress Coupling}
\[
\mu_{eff} = \mu_0 (1 - \gamma \sigma_{eff}),
\]
where $\sigma_{eff}$ is proportional to $\Delta T$. Delay couples to both $T$ and $\sigma$.

\section{Control Architecture}
We propose a three-layer architecture:  
1) \textbf{PID controller:} Regulates delay deviation $\varepsilon_d$ via DVFS actuation $u$.  
2) \textbf{FSM guard:} Enforces HOT mode when $T_{top}>85^\circ$C, bounding $u \leq u_{max}$.  
3) \textbf{LLM supervisor:} Retunes $(K_p,K_i,K_d)$ and FSM thresholds when overshoot/error exceed tolerance.  
These layers provide stability (PID), safety (FSM), and adaptability (LLM).

\section{Experimental Setup}
Simulations were performed using SystemDK 2025 with $dt=1$ ns and horizon 1.5 s. Parameters:  
$R_{via}=1$--10 $\Omega$, $C_{inter}=1$--5 fF, $P_{burst}=0.1$--1.0 W, $k_c=0.3$--0.9, $\gamma=0.05$--0.2.  
Thermal RC constants were from compact models. PID initial gains via Ziegler–Nichols, FSM threshold $85^\circ$C, LLM adaptation enabled.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Without Control}
Burst heating increased delay deviation $\sim$8\%. Stress coupling further degraded mobility.  
\subsection{PID Only}
Error reduced $>10\times$, but overshoot remained.  
\subsection{PID + FSM}
Clamped actuation under hotspots, safe but inflexible.  
\subsection{PID + FSM + LLM (Proposed)}
Smooth convergence across all conditions. Peak error $2.6 \times 10^{-3}$, steady-state error $<10^{-6}$, robust across $\gamma=0.05$--0.2.

\section{Stability Analysis}
Closed-loop transfer:
\[
T(s) = \frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)}, \quad L(s)=C(s)G(s).
\]
PID ensured phase margin $>45^\circ$, gain margin $>6$ dB. FSM bounded $u$, LLM preserved stability as $\{k_c,\gamma,P\}$ drifted.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}
\subsection{Significance}
Shifts CFET design from static to dynamic compensation.  
\subsection{Comparison with Static Design}
Static methods ignore time evolution; our method uses convergence as design target.  
\subsection{Limitations}
Compact-model abstraction, unmodeled noise/variation, LLM hardware overhead.  
\subsection{Future Work}
Chip-in-loop validation, forksheet/3D CFET extension, integration with cooling and NoC control.  

\section{Conclusion}
We proposed a time-response-aware CFET design with PID+FSM+LLM supervision. Delay and thermal effects were stabilized under dynamic workloads, reframing DTCO from static prediction to dynamic compensation. Time-response-aware design is essential for sub-2\,nm integration.
