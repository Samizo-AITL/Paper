\begin{abstract}
This paper analyzes a historical failure case at the 0.25\,\textmu m CMOS node related to Ti silicide (TiSi\textsubscript{2}) phase-transition instability. 
For active-matrix TFT (aTFT) LCD driver ICs that required mixed 3.3~V logic and $\sim$30~V devices, manufacturers selected the 0.25\,\textmu m node because its LOCOS isolation safely supported high-voltage (HV) co-integration; the 0.18\,\textmu m STI-based node, although denser and yield-stable, posed edge-thinning risks for $\sim$30~V devices. 
Under this context, incomplete C49$\rightarrow$C54 transformation with boron absorption created localized high-resistance spots, directly reducing 1~Mbit SRAM yield.
The study highlights how process optimization and empirical feedback cycles were indispensable when isolation technology and device requirements constrained node selection.

\section{Introduction}
In the late 1990s, LCD drivers for monochrome passive panels were commonly fabricated in 0.35\,\textmu m processes supporting 3.3~V logic and 40~V HV devices.
With the shift to color aTFT panels in the early 2000s, driver ICs required higher-performance logic, embedded large SRAM macros, and continued HV device integration around 30~V.

Although the 0.18\,\textmu m CMOS process was already in mass production with small die size and stable yield, it relied on Shallow Trench Isolation (STI), where edge thinning introduced a reliability risk for $\sim$30~V devices.
By contrast, the 0.25\,\textmu m process used Local Oxidation of Silicon (LOCOS), which had a proven track record for HV isolation.
Therefore, manufacturers adopted the 0.25\,\textmu m LOCOS-based process for 3.3~V + 30~V LCD driver ICs, accepting area disadvantages to guarantee HV compatibility.

% -------------------- Technical Background --------------------
\section{Technical Background}
\subsection{Isolation Choice for HV Devices}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{0.25\,\textmu m LOCOS}: mature, thick field oxide; well-established margins for $\sim$30~V device isolation.
  \item \textbf{0.18\,\textmu m STI}: shallow trench isolation; better density, but isolation-corner thinning required a new HV device development and qualification flow.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ti Silicide Issues}
TiSi\textsubscript{2} was adopted for low resistivity but requires a C49$\rightarrow$C54 phase transformation during RTA.
If the transformation is incomplete, residual C49 grains remain as high-resistance regions.
Boron absorption from halo implants into Ti/TiSi\textsubscript{2} aggravated local resistivity variation.
These effects were largely latent at smaller memory macros (e.g., 500~kbit), but became visible when the array scaled to 1~Mbit.

% -------------------- Failure Analysis --------------------
\section{Failure Analysis}
\subsection{Observation: 1 Mbit SRAM}
In mass production, random single-bit failures appeared in the 1~Mbit SRAM macro.
Because redundancy was not implemented in the embedded macro, even one defective bit caused device rejection.

\subsection{Root Cause}
Failure localization indicated that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Halo boron was partially absorbed into Ti during silicide formation.
  \item The local B uptake inhibited C54 formation, leaving high-resistance C49 regions.
  \item These high-resistance spots manifested as random SRAM cell failures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Review Limitation}
Earlier products integrating 500~kbit SRAM macros had not shown this issue.
Based on those precedents, the team assumed that scaling to 1~Mbit would be acceptable.
Consequently, the failure mode was not identified during the initial development review stage.

\end{figure}

% -------------------- Countermeasures --------------------
\section{Countermeasures}
\subsection{Provisional}
Etch profiles were tuned to slightly undercut sidewalls, increasing separation between halo regions and Ti, which improved yield significantly.

\subsection{Permanent}
RTA conditions were optimized to favor stable C54 formation.
However, this altered device parameters and required re-characterization of process/device models.

% -------------------- Educational Application --------------------
\section{Educational Application}
\subsection{Teaching Tools}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cause–effect diagrams: process $\rightarrow$ defect $\rightarrow$ yield.
  \item Comparative table: 0.25\,\textmu m (LOCOS) vs.\ 0.18\,\textmu m (STI) for HV devices (Table~\ref{tab:node-comparison}).
  \item Exercises: prioritize process improvement vs.\ introduce redundancy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lessons}
Relying only on 500~kbit SRAM yield data led to an incorrect assumption at 1~Mbit.
Given STI was not yet qualified for 30~V devices at that time, 0.25\,\textmu m LOCOS was the only feasible platform—yet it carried a silicide-instability risk that required explicit mitigation.

% -------------------- Conclusion --------------------
\section{Conclusion}
This case demonstrates how HV compatibility constraints can dominate node selection.
Despite the availability of a denser, yield-stable 0.18\,\textmu m STI process, the need for safe $\sim$30~V integration drove adoption of 0.25\,\textmu m LOCOS.
Yield loss from incomplete TiSi\textsubscript{2} phase transformation (with boron absorption) became critical at the 1~Mbit SRAM scale.
The educational value lies in showing how scaling, isolation technology, and process reliability intersect, and why continuous empirical feedback is essential.
