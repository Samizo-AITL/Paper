\begin{abstract}
This paper analyzes a historical failure case related to Ti silicide (TiSi\textsubscript{2}) phase transition instability at the 0.25~µm CMOS node. 
The incomplete C49$\rightarrow$C54 transformation, coupled with boron absorption, caused localized high-resistance spots that directly reduced SRAM yield. 
The case illustrates how process optimization and empirical feedback cycles became indispensable in semiconductor development, particularly when economic pressure and high-voltage compatibility shaped process selection.

\section{Introduction}
In the late 1990s, LCD drivers for passive monochrome panels were commonly fabricated in 0.35~µm nodes supporting 3.3~V logic and 40~V high-voltage transistors.  
With the transition to active-matrix TFT (aTFT) color panels in the early 2000s, demand increased for higher-performance logic and embedded SRAM, along with high-voltage device integration.  

Although the 0.18~µm process was already in mass production and offered smaller chip size and stable yield, it relied on shallow trench isolation (STI). STI edge thinning posed risks for 30~V device reliability.  
By contrast, the 0.25~µm process used local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS), which had a proven track record in high-voltage isolation.  
Therefore, manufacturers adopted the 0.25~µm LOCOS process (3.3~V + 30~V) for LCD driver ICs despite disadvantages in chip area.

\section{Technical Background}
TiSi\textsubscript{2} was widely adopted for its low resistivity. 
However, the silicide undergoes a phase transition from metastable C49 to stable C54 during rapid thermal annealing (RTA). 
If the transition is incomplete, residual C49 grains act as high-resistance regions. 
Furthermore, boron absorption into TiSi\textsubscript{2} aggravated resistance fluctuation, directly manifesting as random SRAM bit failures.

\section{Failure Analysis}
In early products embedding 500k-bit SRAM macros, the instability did not critically manifest.  
However, with 1M-bit macros, single-bit failures became frequent due to localized high-resistance spots in transistor contact regions.  
Because no redundancy was included, each defect directly caused chip rejection.  
At the development review stage, these issues were not anticipated, as empirical data from smaller SRAM macros suggested acceptable yield.

\section{Design Review Limitations}
Design reviews (DR) primarily checked rule compliance and did not evaluate risks arising from incomplete silicide transformation.  
Since prior SRAM macros (≤500k bits) had not shown systematic failure, extrapolation to 1M-bit macros appeared reasonable but proved incorrect.  

\section{Countermeasures}
\subsection{Provisional Measures}
Etch profiles were adjusted to slightly undercut sidewalls, ensuring sufficient separation between halo implants and active regions.  
This temporarily improved yield.

\subsection{Permanent Measures}
RTA conditions were optimized to stabilize C54 phase formation.  
However, this altered device parameters, requiring re-characterization of process-device models.

\section{Educational Application}
\subsection{Teaching Materials}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cause-effect diagrams (process $\rightarrow$ defect $\rightarrow$ yield)
    \item Comparative table: 0.25~µm (LOCOS) vs 0.18~µm (STI) for HV devices
    \item Exercises: prioritize process fix vs introduce redundancy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Universality}
The trade-off was not merely cost vs. stability but meeting the integration requirements of active-matrix LCD drivers: high-performance logic, large SRAM, and safe HV operation.  
Such process-selection dilemmas remain relevant in later nodes (e.g., 28~nm FD-SOI reuse, 40~nm BCD continuity).

\section{Conclusion}
This case demonstrates how the need for HV compatibility constrained process selection, leading to the adoption of 0.25~µm LOCOS despite the availability of a smaller, stable 0.18~µm STI process.  
Yield degradation from incomplete TiSi\textsubscript{2} phase transition highlighted the necessity of empirical feedback cycles in design and process development.  
Its educational value lies in using historical semiconductor case studies to teach the interaction of technology, reliability, and market context.
