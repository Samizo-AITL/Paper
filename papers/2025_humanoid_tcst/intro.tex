\section{Introduction}
Humanoid robots represent one of the most challenging applications in modern control systems,
requiring robust dynamic stabilization, real-time adaptation to disturbances,
and high-level decision-making capabilities.
Recent advancements such as Boston Dynamics Atlas and Tesla Optimus
have demonstrated impressive mobility and manipulation skills.
However, these platforms primarily emphasize either dynamic performance
or industrial deployment, while critical aspects such as autonomy,
fault tolerance, and sustainable operation remain underexplored.

This work presents a flagship proof-of-concept (PoC) humanoid robot
that integrates finite state machines (FSM), proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control,
state-space methods, and large language models (LLMs) into a unified architecture.
The key contribution is a hierarchical control design where low-level stability
and mid-level behavior switching are coordinated with high-level goal generation
and anomaly interpretation provided by the LLM layer.

The proposed system is implemented as a cross-node design,
spanning a 22 nm SoC for inference and control, a 0.18 µm AMS sensor hub,
and a 0.35 µm LDMOS drive with external power chips.
System-level validation using SystemDK demonstrates that the hybrid control
achieves posture recovery within 200 ms, improves gait stability by 30\%,
and enhances energy efficiency by 15\% compared to PID-only baselines.
