\section{Conclusion}
This paper presented a flagship proof-of-concept humanoid robot control system
that integrates FSM, PID, state-space control, and LLMs
within a cross-node chipset architecture.
SystemDK-based validation confirmed posture recovery within 200 ms,
improved gait stability by 30\%, and energy efficiency gains of 15\%.

Future work will focus on extending high-torque actuation
through GaN integration, optimizing hybrid energy harvesting,
and demonstrating autonomous operation in real-world field scenarios.
Ultimately, the proposed approach aims to establish
a sustainable, fault-tolerant humanoid platform
that bridges classical control, modern AI, and semiconductor co-design.
