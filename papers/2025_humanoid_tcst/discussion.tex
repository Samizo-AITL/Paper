\section{Discussion}
Compared to Atlas and Optimus, the proposed system emphasizes autonomy,
fault tolerance, and sustainability rather than purely dynamic performance
or industrial mass deployment.
The integration of LLMs into the hierarchical control loop
enables capabilities such as natural conversation,
personal recognition, and anomaly interpretation,
which are rarely addressed in conventional humanoid platforms.

Educational reproducibility is another distinctive feature.
All PoC specifications and control software are openly published
via GitHub Pages in bilingual format,
allowing the architecture to serve both as a research prototype
and as an educational resource.
