\begin{abstract}
We propose \emph{AITL on Space}, a robust three-layer control architecture (Robust Core, FSM Supervisor, AI Adaptor) integrated with a tri-NVM hierarchy (SRAM/MRAM/FRAM) and mapped to a 22\,nm FD\!SOI SoC. The novelty lies in a complete flow from mission-level specification to ASIC implementation: requirements are formalized as JSON via \emph{EduController}, synthesized by the \emph{AITL-H} module, verified in FPGA HIL with fault injection, stress-tested through \emph{SystemDK FEM} under thermal/radiation/packaging conditions, and finally deployed as ASIC. This end-to-end methodology enables resilient autonomy for long-duration spacecraft missions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Deep-space missions require ultra-robust control under total ionizing dose (TID), single event effects (SEE), and thermal cycling. Conventional PID\,+\,Flash architectures face limits due to charge-trap drift and endurance. To address these, we present \emph{AITL on Space}: a resilient three-layer architecture supported by a tri-NVM memory hierarchy and a reproducible design flow from JSON specification to ASIC.

\section{Specification and Design Flow}
The design begins with \textbf{mission specification}. Requirements such as plant matrices and weighting functions are captured in \emph{EduController}, a model-based tool that exports a portable JSON description. This JSON is consumed by \emph{AITL-H}, a synthesis module that generates an $H_\infty$ output-feedback controller $K$ in fixed-point form, ensuring suitability for FPGA/ASIC.  
The controller is validated by \textbf{FPGA HIL} with SEU and outage injection. Next, \emph{SystemDK FEM}, a finite-element environment, evaluates thermal, radiation, and packaging stress, closing the verification loop. The design finally maps to a 22FDX ASIC. This structured methodology ensures traceability from mission requirements to silicon.

\section{System Architecture}
AITL consists of three layers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Robust Core}: $H_\infty$/MPC/SMC control.
  \item \textbf{FSM Supervisor}: Safe/Nominal/Recovery with FDI/FDII.
  \item \textbf{AI Adaptor}: long-term re-identification and drift compensation.
\end{itemize}
A tri-NVM hierarchy ensures persistence: SRAM for execution, MRAM for logs/code with ECC scrubbing, and FRAM for safe boot and FSM states. The SoC target is 22\,nm FD\!SOI hardened against radiation and temperature stress.

\section{Mathematical Model and $H_\infty$ Design}
We consider an 11D discrete-time state-space plant:
\begin{align}
x_{k+1} &= A x_k + B u_k + E w_k,\\
y_k &= C x_k + D u_k + v_k,
\end{align}
where $w_k$ and $v_k$ denote disturbance and noise. The model extends to 20D by including translational axes and bias states.  
Weights $(W_1,W_2,W_3)$ shape sensitivity, control effort, and complementary sensitivity. EduController outputs them as JSON; AITL-H synthesizes $K$ with robustness margins, mapped to fixed-point FPGA/ASIC.

\section{Verification Pipeline}
FPGA HIL injects SEU bursts and sensor outages. Metrics include safe-mode entry time ($<\SI{1}{s}$), recovery rate ($\ge\SI{99}{\percent}$), and ECC scrubbing efficiency. SystemDK FEM evaluates thermal/radiation stress and validates packaging before ASIC tape-out.

\section{Conclusion}
AITL on Space combines robust control, supervisory safety, AI re-identification, and hardened memory. The proposed flow---from mission specification to ASIC---provides a reproducible methodology for resilient autonomy in long-duration missions.
