\begin{abstract}
\noindent
We propose \textit{AITL on Space}, a robust three-layer control architecture (Robust Core, FSM Supervisor, AI Adaptor) integrated with a tri-NVM hierarchy (SRAM/MRAM/FRAM) and mapped to a 22\,nm FDSOI SoC. The contribution is a complete end-to-end design flow from mission-level specification to ASIC: requirements are formalized as JSON via EduController, synthesized by the AITL-H module, validated in FPGA HIL with fault injection, stress-tested through SystemDK FEM (thermal/radiation/packaging), and finally implemented as ASIC. This methodology enables resilient autonomy for long-duration spacecraft missions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Deep-space missions require ultra-robust control under total ionizing dose (TID), single event effects (SEE), and thermal cycling. Conventional PID\,+\,Flash architectures face lifetime limits due to charge-trap drift and endurance. We present \emph{AITL on Space}: a resilient three-layer architecture with a tri-NVM hierarchy and a reproducible design flow from specification to ASIC.

\section{Specification and Design Flow}
The process begins with \textbf{Mission Specification}. Requirements such as pointing accuracy, power stability, and thermal tolerance are captured in \textbf{EduController}, a model-based tool that exports plant matrices and weighting functions as JSON (portable across simulators). The JSON is consumed by \textbf{AITL-H}, which synthesizes an $H_\infty$ output-feedback controller $K$ with mixed-sensitivity weighting and generates a fixed-point implementation for RTL/FPGA/ASIC. The design then undergoes:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=1pt,leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{FPGA HIL}: hardware-in-the-loop validation with SEU\,+\,outage injection; metrics include safe-mode entry $<\!1$\,s, recovery rate $\ge 99\%$, and ECC scrubbing efficiency.
  \item \textbf{SystemDK FEM}: co-simulation of thermal cycles, radiation effects, and packaging stress, closing the verification loop before silicon.
  \item \textbf{ASIC Mapping}: implementation on GlobalFoundries 22FDX FDSOI hardened for long-duration missions.
\end{itemize}
\textit{Toolchain at a Glance}. \emph{EduController} $\rightarrow$ spec\,$\rightarrow$\,JSON exporter (plant $A,B,C,D$, noise/disturbance models, weights $W_1,W_2,W_3$). \emph{AITL-H}: $H_\infty$ synthesizer (Riccati/LMI)\,$\rightarrow$\,fixed-point $K$. \emph{SystemDK FEM} = thermal/radiation/packaging derating \& memory scrubbing validation.

\section{System Architecture}
AITL consists of three layers:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=1pt,leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Robust Core}: $H_\infty$/MPC/SMC controllers for stability.
  \item \textbf{FSM Supervisor}: mode switching (Safe/Nominal/Recovery) with FDI/FDI\!I for fault management.
  \item \textbf{AI Adaptor}: long-term re-identification and drift compensation.
\end{itemize}
A tri-NVM hierarchy ensures persistence: SRAM for execution, MRAM for logs/code with ECC scrubbing and dual slots, and FRAM for safe boot and FSM states. Target SoC is 22\,nm FDSOI hardened for radiation and temperature stress.

\section{Mathematical Model and $H_\infty$ Design}
We consider an 11D discrete-time state-space plant coupling attitude (6), power bus (2), and thermal nodes (3):
\begin{align}
x_{k+1} &= A x_k + B u_k + E w_k,\\
y_k     &= C x_k + D u_k + v_k,
\end{align}
where $w_k$ and $v_k$ are disturbance and noise. The model extends to 20D by adding translational axes and bias states. Weights $(W_1,W_2,W_3)$ shape sensitivity, control effort, and complementary sensitivity. \textit{EduController} outputs them as JSON; \textit{AITL-H} synthesizes $K$ with robustness margins and exports a fixed-point realization for RTL/FPGA/ASIC.

\section{Verification Pipeline}
FPGA HIL injects SEUs and sensor outages. Metrics include safe-mode entry time ($<\!1$\,s), recovery rate ($\ge 99\%$), and ECC scrubbing efficiency. \textit{SystemDK FEM} validates thermal and radiation stress, ensuring packaging reliability before ASIC tape-out.

\section{Conclusion}
\textit{AITL on Space} combines robust control, supervisory safety, AI re-identification, and hardened memory. The proposed end-to-end flow—from mission specification to ASIC—provides a reproducible methodology for resilient autonomy in long-duration space missions.
