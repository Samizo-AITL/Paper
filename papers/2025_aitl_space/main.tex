\begin{abstract}
We propose \emph{AITL on Space}, a robust three-layer control architecture (Robust Core, FSM Supervisor, AI Adaptor) integrated with a tri-NVM hierarchy (SRAM/MRAM/FRAM) and mapped to a 22\,nm FD\!SOI SoC. The novelty lies in a complete flow from mission-level specification to ASIC implementation: requirements are formalized as JSON via EduController, synthesized by the AITL-H module, validated in FPGA HIL with fault injection, stress-tested through SystemDK FEM, and finally implemented as ASIC. This structured end-to-end methodology enables resilient autonomy for long-duration spacecraft missions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Deep-space missions require ultra-robust control under total ionizing dose (TID), single event effects (SEE), and thermal cycling. Conventional PID\,+\,Flash architectures face lifetime limits due to charge-trap drift and endurance. To address these, we present AITL on Space: a resilient three-layer architecture supported by a tri-NVM memory hierarchy and a reproducible design flow spanning from specification to ASIC.

\section{Specification and Design Flow}
The design process begins with \emph{Mission Specification}, where requirements such as pointing accuracy, power stability, and thermal tolerance are translated into plant models and weighting functions in EduController. These are exported as JSON, forming a portable description. The JSON is consumed by AITL-H, which synthesizes an $H_\infty$ controller $K$ with mixed-sensitivity weighting. The design then undergoes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item FPGA HIL verification with SEU and outage injection,
  \item SystemDK FEM analysis for thermal/radiation/packaging stress,
  \item Mapping to 22FDX ASIC for final deployment.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Architecture}
AITL consists of three layers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Robust Core}: $H_\infty$/MPC/SMC controllers for stability.
  \item \textbf{FSM Supervisor}: Mode switching (Safe/Nominal/Recovery) with FDI/FDII for fault management.
  \item \textbf{AI Adaptor}: Long-term re-identification and drift compensation.
\end{itemize}

The tri-NVM hierarchy ensures persistence: SRAM for execution, MRAM for logs/code with ECC scrubbing and dual slots, and FRAM for safe boot and FSM states. The SoC target is 22\,nm FD\!SOI hardened against radiation and temperature stress.

\section{Mathematical Model and $H_\infty$ Design}
We consider an 11D discrete-time state-space plant coupling attitude (6), power bus (2), and thermal nodes (3):
\begin{align}
x_{k+1} &= A x_k + B u_k + E w_k, \\
y_k &= C x_k + D u_k + v_k.
\end{align}
Here $w_k$ and $v_k$ denote disturbance and noise. The model extends to 20D by including translational axes and bias states.

Weights $(W_1,W_2,W_3)$ shape sensitivity, control effort, and complementary sensitivity. EduController outputs them as JSON; AITL-H synthesizes $K$ with robustness margins, mapped to fixed-point FPGA/ASIC.

\section{Verification Pipeline}
FPGA HIL injects SEU bursts and outages, measuring safe-mode entry ($<\SI{1}{s}$), recovery rate ($\ge\SI{99}{\percent}$), and ECC scrubbing efficiency. SystemDK FEM evaluates thermal and radiation stress, ensuring packaging reliability before ASIC tape-out.

\section{Conclusion}
AITL on Space combines robust control, supervisory safety, AI re-identification, and hardened memory. The proposed end-to-end flow—from mission specification to ASIC—provides a reproducible methodology for resilient autonomy in long-duration space missions.
