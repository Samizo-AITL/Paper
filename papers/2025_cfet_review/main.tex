\begin{abstract}
This tutorial paper provides an educational overview of emerging
\emph{Complementary FET (CFET)} technology, which vertically stacks nFET and pFET devices beyond Gate-All-Around (GAA) nanosheets.
CFET reframes the CMOS inverter as a \emph{cross-sectional} integration, promising density and delay improvements.
We consolidate structure, electrostatic motivations, layout and delay impacts, fabrication challenges, and modeling limitations, and articulate the pedagogical value of CFET as an open, unresolved technology for semiconductor curricula.

\section{Introduction}
Scaling has progressed from planar CMOS to FinFET and most recently GAA nanosheet FETs.
Beyond the 2\,nm node, interconnect delay and cell footprint limit further gains despite excellent electrostatics.
CFET stacks nFET and pFET in the vertical dimension so that the cross-section itself constitutes a CMOS inverter, potentially doubling effective standard-cell density while shortening n--p connections.
This paper positions CFET as both a roadmap element and an educational vehicle for device--design co-optimization.

% =========================
\section{Device Evolution: From SCE Relief to Cross-Sectional CMOS}
\subsection{Planar CMOS and SCE Motivation}
As gate lengths entered the deep sub-100\,nm regime, planar MOSFETs suffered
from short-channel effects (SCE): threshold-voltage roll-off, drain-induced barrier lowering, off-state leakage, and degraded subthreshold slope.
Electrostatic control by a single top gate could no longer effectively pinch off the channel.

\subsection{FinFET: Three-Sided Gate Control}
FinFETs improved electrostatics by wrapping the gate around \emph{three} sides of a vertical fin.
The stronger gate-to-channel coupling sharpened subthreshold slope, reduced variability, and enabled higher drive per footprint by using multiple fins per device.
However, the tall/narrow fin introduced process and variability trade-offs and left one side of the channel uncontrolled.

\subsection{GAA Nanosheet: Four-Sided Control}
Gate-All-Around (GAA) nanosheet FETs extend control to \emph{four} sides by surrounding suspended sheets (or wires) with the gate.
This architecture further suppresses SCE and variability and allows continued gate-length scaling.
Yet, at advanced nodes the delay/energy bottleneck increasingly shifts from device electrostatics to \emph{wiring}: local interconnect resistance/capacitance (RC) and the lateral footprint of standard cells.

\subsection{CFET: Stacking Complementary Devices}
CFET addresses wiring and density limits by placing nFET and pFET in the \emph{same lateral footprint} and connecting them vertically.
Educational takeaways are:
(i) effective cell density can approach $\sim 2\times$ by sharing diffusion/gate footprint across polarities; and
(ii) the critical n-to-p connection in inverters and logic stacks shortens, reducing local RC and stage delay.
In short, CFET reframes CMOS as a \emph{cross-sectional inverter} rather than a lateral pair.

\section{CFET Structural Concepts}
Two representative integration styles are considered.

\paragraph*{(i) Sequential CFET}
nFET is fabricated first, followed by pFET under a constrained thermal budget. Selective epitaxy/etch and dielectric isolation are crucial, as is vertical contact to the inverter output.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\end{tikzpicture}}
\caption{Sequential CFET cross-section with stacked nFET/pFET and vertical output via.}
\label{fig:cfet_stack}
\end{figure}

\paragraph*{(ii) Forksheet CFET}
n/p channels are placed orthogonally with a dielectric ``fork'' spacer to ease routing congestion and preserve electrostatics.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\section{Electrical and Layout Impacts}
Key educational points include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Area efficiency:} Near $\sim 2\times$ density for inverter cells; benefits extend to NAND/NOR by co-locating pull-up and pull-down networks.
  \item \textbf{Delay/energy:} Vertical n-to-p via shortens RC path; FO1 delay can improve even if device $I\!-\!V$ matches GAA.
  \item \textbf{Electrostatics:} Each tier can retain GAA-level control; inter-tier coupling introduces parasitics (capacitance, via resistance).
  \item \textbf{Variability/noise:} Thermal coupling and VDD/GND partitioning introduce asymmetries requiring placement and power-routing co-optimization (e.g., AOI/OAI stacks).
\end{itemize}

% =========================
\section{Manufacturing Challenges}
Realizing CFET integration introduces unprecedented fabrication hurdles.
Independent n/p work-functions and junctions across stacked tiers demand highly selective epitaxy and etching steps at low thermal budgets ($<500^{\circ}$C) to preserve the completed tier.
Alignment tolerance for vertical vias is sub-5\,nm.
Dielectric isolation must suppress dopant/defect diffusion while maintaining mechanical integrity across multiple layers.
Recent demonstrations by IMEC indicate sequential CFET feasibility, while scaling reliability and yield remain open challenges~\cite{imec_cfet_iedm2020}.

% =========================
\section{Modeling and EDA Limitations}
Existing compact models such as BSIM-CMG capture GAA behavior but do not cover CFET-specific vertical coupling, thermal interactions, or stacked-via parasitics.
Prototype Verilog-A implementations exist without consensus and calibration.
No open CFET-ready PDKs or standard-cell libraries are available, preventing standardized design flows.
These gaps limit immediate design enablement yet provide a fertile educational sandbox~\cite{bsimcmg_sispad2017}.

% =========================
\section{Educational Value}
From a pedagogical perspective, CFET provides a unique opportunity to bridge device physics, fabrication, layout, and CAD.
Graduate courses can integrate CFET Verilog-A projects, sensitivity studies to inter-tier parasitics, and DTCO case studies aligned with public roadmaps such as IRDS~\cite{irds_2023}.

% =========================
\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
CFET reframes CMOS as a stacked, cross-sectional inverter that simultaneously improves density and wiring delay.
Looking forward, forksheet layouts, 3D sequential stacks, thermal-aware power partitioning, and System-on-Stack integration are promising directions.
Embedding CFET in curricula helps prepare engineers for unresolved challenges at the frontier of scaling.
