\begin{abstract}
This tutorial paper provides an educational overview of emerging
\emph{Complementary FET (CFET)} technology, which vertically stacks nFET and pFET devices beyond Gate-All-Around (GAA) nanosheets.
CFET reframes the CMOS inverter as a \emph{cross-sectional} integration, promising density and delay improvements.
We consolidate structure, electrostatic motivations, layout and delay impacts, fabrication challenges, and modeling limitations, and articulate the pedagogical value of CFET as an open, unresolved technology for semiconductor curricula.

\section{Introduction}
Scaling has progressed from planar CMOS to FinFET and most recently GAA nanosheet FETs.
Beyond the 2\,nm node, interconnect delay and cell footprint limit further gains despite excellent electrostatics.
CFET stacks nFET and pFET in the vertical dimension so that the cross-section itself constitutes a CMOS inverter, potentially doubling effective standard-cell density while shortening n--p connections.
This paper positions CFET as both a roadmap element and an educational vehicle for device--design co-optimization.

% =========================
\section{Device Evolution: From SCE Relief to Cross-Sectional CMOS}

Scaling history can be viewed as a sequence of innovations in
gate–channel electrostatics. Each generation provided stronger
short-channel control, but also introduced new integration
bottlenecks that motivated the next architectural shift.

\subsection{Planar CMOS: Collapse under SCE}
As gate lengths entered the deep sub-100\,nm regime, planar MOSFETs
suffered severely from short-channel effects (SCE): threshold-voltage
roll-off, drain-induced barrier lowering, large off-state leakage, and
degraded subthreshold slope. Electrostatic control by a single top gate
was insufficient, leading to the collapse of classical planar scaling.

\subsection{FinFET: Three-Sided Gate Recovery}
FinFETs restored scalability by wrapping the gate around
\emph{three} sides of a vertical fin. The enhanced gate coupling
sharpened subthreshold slope, improved variability, and enabled
multi-fin drive current scaling per device. However, the tall/narrow
fin introduced new trade-offs: sensitivity to line-edge roughness,
process variability, and the fact that one side of the channel
remained ungated.

\subsection{GAA Nanosheet: Four-Sided Ideal Control}
Gate-All-Around (GAA) nanosheet FETs extended electrostatics to
\emph{four} sides by surrounding suspended sheets with the gate. This
architecture nearly idealized SCE suppression and variability control,
enabling sub-3\,nm nodes \cite{bsimcmg_sispad2017}. Yet, as device
electrostatics became nearly perfect, the performance bottleneck
shifted toward \emph{wiring}: local interconnect resistance/capacitance
(RC) and the lateral footprint of standard cells limited further
delay/energy gains.

\subsection{CFET: Cross-Sectional CMOS Integration}
Complementary FETs (CFETs) address wiring and density limits by stacking
nFET and pFET devices in the \emph{same lateral footprint} and
connecting them vertically. Educational takeaways are:
(i) effective cell density can nearly double by sharing
diffusion/gate footprint across polarities; and
(ii) the critical n-to-p connection in inverters and logic networks is
shortened, reducing local RC and FO1 delay. In effect, CFET reframes
CMOS as a \emph{cross-sectional inverter} rather than a lateral pair
\cite{imec_cfet_iedm2020}. While promising, CFETs also introduce
new integration challenges: $<5$\,nm alignment tolerance, low thermal
budget for sequential processing, and inter-tier parasitic coupling.

\section{CFET Structural Concepts}
Two integration styles are considered, reflecting a likely roadmap progression:
first the \emph{Sequential CFET} as the initial implementation candidate,
and then the \emph{Forksheet CFET} as a possible successor if inter-tier
interference proves problematic.

\paragraph*{(i) Sequential CFET}
The first integration style expected in practice is the Sequential CFET.
Here, the nFET tier is fabricated first, followed by the pFET tier stacked
above it under a constrained thermal budget. Selective epitaxy/etch and
dielectric isolation are crucial, as is vertical contact to the inverter output.
Because n- and p-devices are stacked in close proximity, however,
concerns arise regarding electrostatic coupling, vertical via parasitics,
and thermal interference between tiers.

\label{fig:cfet_stack}
\end{figure}

\paragraph*{(ii) Forksheet CFET}
If interference in Sequential CFETs becomes too severe, a next-step option is the
Forksheet CFET. In this style, n- and p-channels are placed orthogonally and
separated by a dielectric ``fork'' spacer. This geometry helps mitigate
inter-tier parasitics, preserves electrostatic control, and eases routing
congestion.

% =========================
\section{Electrical and Layout Impacts}
CFET integration affects not only cell density but also delay,
variability, and power distribution in ways that extend beyond GAA
devices. Key educational points include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Area efficiency:} By vertically stacking nFET and pFET
  within the same lateral footprint, inverter density can approach
  nearly $2\times$. This benefit extends to complex logic cells
  (e.g., NAND/NOR) by co-locating pull-up and pull-down networks in
  the same footprint. Students should recognize how this structural
  gain cascades into standard-cell library design and physical design
  rules.

  \item \textbf{Delay/energy:} The vertical n-to-p via drastically
  shortens the inverter's RC path compared to lateral wiring in GAA.
  Even if individual $I$–$V$ device curves remain similar to GAA,
  FO1 delay and stage energy are improved due to reduced
  interconnect loading. This highlights the shift of scaling benefit
  from device $I\!-\!V$ to wiring geometry.

  \item \textbf{Electrostatics:} Each tier can retain GAA-level control,
  but inter-tier electric-field coupling introduces new parasitics
  (capacitance, via resistance). This provides an excellent tutorial
  case where device electrostatics interact with circuit parasitics,
  requiring students to think about multi-physics co-optimization.

  \item \textbf{Variability/noise:} Vertical stacking introduces thermal
  coupling between tiers, causing asymmetric heating of n/p devices.
  Furthermore, VDD and GND partitioning across layers generates
  uneven IR drop and noise susceptibility. These effects demand new
  placement and routing strategies, illustrating how device
  innovations ripple up into CAD tool requirements.
\end{itemize}

% =========================
\section{Manufacturing Challenges}
Realizing CFETs requires overcoming fabrication hurdles that exceed
previous scaling transitions. Educationally, these challenges reveal
how device physics, materials science, and process integration are
deeply intertwined.

Independent n/p work-functions and junctions across stacked tiers
demand highly selective epitaxy and etching, often under low thermal
budgets ($<500^{\circ}$C) to avoid damaging the completed tier.
Vertical via alignment must achieve sub-5\,nm overlay, pushing EUV
lithography beyond current overlay standards. Dielectric isolation
must simultaneously suppress dopant diffusion and preserve mechanical
integrity across multiple stacked layers.

Recent demonstrations by IMEC indicate that sequential CFETs are
feasible at the research level. However, industrial-scale yield,
variability control, and long-term reliability remain unresolved,
making this a rich topic for classroom debate on manufacturability
versus theoretical scaling.

% =========================
\section{Modeling and EDA Limitations}
Existing compact models such as BSIM-CMG can capture GAA device
behavior, but lack extensions for CFET-specific effects. Missing
aspects include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Inter-tier electrostatics and capacitive coupling,
  \item Vertical thermal interactions between stacked devices,
  \item Parasitic RC from vertical vias and tier-to-tier contacts.
\end{enumerate}

Prototype Verilog-A models have been proposed but lack consensus,
calibration, and reproducibility across foundries. Furthermore, no
open-source CFET-ready PDKs or standard-cell libraries are available,
preventing standardized design flows. From an educational
perspective, this modeling gap provides fertile ground for coursework:
students can extend compact models, explore sensitivity analysis, and
appreciate the impact of missing parasitics on design predictions.

% =========================
\section{Educational Value}
From a pedagogical perspective, CFET is more than a new device—it is
a framework for integrating physics, process, layout, and CAD.
Graduate courses can incorporate:
\begin{itemize}
  \item CFET Verilog-A models as design projects,
  \item Sensitivity studies to inter-tier parasitics,
  \item Placement/routing co-optimization exercises,
  \item Roadmap-based discussions linking IRDS forecasts with
  design-technology co-optimization (DTCO).
\end{itemize}

Instructors can use CFET to demonstrate the shift from device-level
abstraction toward system-level design, illustrating the necessity of
DTCO in the post-GAA era.

% =========================
\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
CFET reframes CMOS as a stacked, cross-sectional inverter that
simultaneously improves density and wiring delay. Looking forward,
several research vectors emerge:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Forksheet CFET layouts to mitigate inter-tier interference,
  \item 3D sequential stacks under constrained thermal budgets,
  \item Thermal-aware power partitioning across vertical tiers,
  \item Co-optimized BEOL integration to reduce parasitic loading,
  \item AI-driven exploration of design space for DTCO.
\end{itemize}

Embedding CFET into semiconductor curricula not only prepares
engineers for the 2030s, but also fosters critical thinking about
unresolved challenges at the scaling frontier—where physics,
fabrication, and system design converge.
