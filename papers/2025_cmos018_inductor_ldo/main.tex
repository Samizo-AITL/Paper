\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes an on-chip laminated magnetic inductor implemented in \SI{0.18}{\micro\meter} CMOS technology with integrated pyrolytic graphite sheet (PGS) for thermal management. The device is applied to a hybrid Buck--LDO power supply for automotive SoC applications, achieving both high power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and fast transient response. Comparative performance metrics are provided against conventional air-core inductors.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{O}{n}-chip inductors are critical components in integrated voltage regulators, especially in automotive SoCs requiring high reliability under harsh conditions (up to 150$^\circ$C, AEC-Q100). Conventional air-core inductors suffer from limited inductance density and poor efficiency. To overcome these issues, laminated magnetic cores combined with pyrolytic graphite sheet (PGS) heat spreaders are proposed.

\section{Proposed Structure}
Fig.~\ref{fig1} shows the cross-sectional concept of the laminated magnetic inductor with integrated PGS in the BEOL stack.

\section{Hybrid Buck--LDO Configuration}
The proposed inductor is applied to a hybrid DC--DC converter consisting of a switching Buck stage followed by a linear LDO, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig2}.

\section{Performance Summary}
Table~\ref{tab1} summarizes the target performance metrics of the proposed laminated inductor compared with a conventional air-core structure.

\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
Metric & Air-Core & Proposed \\
\midrule
Inductance density & Low & High \\
PSRR @1MHz & $<30$ dB & $>50$ dB \\
Transient response & $\pm 50$ mV & $\pm 20$ mV \\
Thermal resistance & High & Low (with PGS) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Target Characteristics}
The PSRR and transient performance are illustrated in Figs.~\ref{fig4} and \ref{fig5}.

\section{Conclusion}
A laminated on-chip magnetic inductor with integrated PGS is proposed and demonstrated in 0.18-$\mu$m CMOS technology. Application to a hybrid Buck--LDO power supply shows significant improvements in PSRR, transient response, and thermal performance, making the approach suitable for automotive SoCs.
