\section{Introduction}

Mobile edge AI platforms such as smartphones, wearables, and embedded accelerators require memory subsystems that balance
\emph{bandwidth}, \emph{energy efficiency}, and \emph{responsiveness}.
Low-power DRAM (LPDDR) has become the de facto main memory for these devices, delivering tens to hundreds of~GB/s bandwidth
with lower I/O energy than server-class high-bandwidth memory (HBM)~\cite{ChoiIEDM2022}.
Nevertheless, LPDDR remains \emph{volatile} and depends on periodic refresh, which incurs standby-power overhead
and constrains energy efficiency in always-connected modes.

Non-volatile memories (NVMs) such as ReRAM, MRAM, and FeRAM have been explored as replacements or complements to DRAM~\cite{NohedaNRM2023,WongProcIEEE2012,IkedaNature2010,WeebitIEDM2022}.
Among these, ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM) based on HfO$_2$ shows promise: it offers low-voltage switching, sub-$10$~ns-class rewriting, and long retention~\cite{MullerAPL2011,KimIEDM2021}.
However, direct monolithic integration of LPDDR and FeRAM is not feasible due to severe process--temperature mismatch:
DRAM capacitors require high-temperature anneals ($>700\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$), whereas ferroelectric crystallization in HfO$_2$ must remain near $400\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$.
This incompatibility motivates heterogeneous integration at the \emph{package level} rather than within a single process flow.

In this work, we propose \textbf{LPDDR+FeRAM integration via chiplet or system-in-package (SiP/PoP) assembly}.
LPDDR continues to serve as the primary working memory, while a small FeRAM die acts as an assistive checkpoint and refresh-offload memory.
The organization is supervised by the \emph{SystemDK} co-design framework, which coordinates policies across hardware, packaging, and runtime software.

\textbf{Target implementation nodes are as follows:}
SoC logic fabricated at 5--3\,nm (FinFET/GAAFET),
LPDDR5/5X DRAM dies at 1$\alpha$--1$\gamma$ generations ($\sim$14--10\,nm),
and FeRAM chiplets implemented in mature 28--22\,nm CMOS.
This heterogeneous combination reflects realistic foundry offerings and motivates the chiplet-level integration strategy.

Figure~\ref{fig:concept_lpddr_feram} illustrates the high-level concept:
LPDDR supplies high-bandwidth working memory, FeRAM chiplets retain state with negligible standby power,
and SystemDK supervision ensures seamless operation for mobile edge AI workloads.
