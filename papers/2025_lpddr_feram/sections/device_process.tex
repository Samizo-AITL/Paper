\section{Device and Process Integration}

\subsection{LPDDR Technology Background}
Low-power DRAM (LPDDR) is the de-facto main memory for mobile systems, providing tens to a few hundreds of~GB/s bandwidth
at substantially lower I/O energy than HBM-class DRAM~\cite{ChoiIEDM2022}.
Despite architectural and I/O optimizations, LPDDR is \emph{volatile} and incurs standby power due to periodic refresh.

\subsection{FeRAM Device and Process}
Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM) based on doped HfO$_2$ leverages polarization switching to store data with low write voltage and fast access~\cite{MullerAPL2011,KimIEDM2021,NohedaNRM2023}.
Process-wise, FeRAM/FeFET flows require \emph{low-to-mid} temperature stabilization ($\sim$350--450$^\circ$C) to preserve the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase in HfZrO$_2$.

\subsection{Why Monolithic Co-Integration Is Impractical}
LPDDR DRAM arrays rely on high-temperature anneals ($>$700$^\circ$C) to realize high-quality storage capacitors.
Such thermal budgets collapse the ferroelectric phase of HfO$_2$, whereas post-FeRAM low-temperature windows cannot support DRAM capacitor quality.
Therefore, monolithic LPDDR+FeRAM co-fabrication is \textbf{impractical}; a package-level approach is required.

\subsection{Package-Level Integration: Chiplet/SiP/PoP}
Figure~\ref{fig:package_lpddr_feram} shows our organization:
(1) LPDDR remains as a standard DRAM die/package optimized in its own process;
(2) a small FeRAM die (chiplet) is co-packaged on a common substrate (SiP/interposer or PoP);
(3) the SoC connects to both through short, low-parasitic interconnects.
This separation preserves each technology's process window while enabling system-level policies to exploit non-volatility.

\subsection{Interface and Policy Hooks}
The FeRAM chiplet exposes a narrow, reliable link (e.g., mailbox DMA or AXI-lite) for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Checkpoint Write/Read}: bulk DMA of model/activation checkpoints and OS state.
  \item \textbf{Refresh Offloading}: firmware migrates cold regions from LPDDR to FeRAM, suppressing refresh traffic.
  \item \textbf{Instant Resume}: fast restore path avoiding full DRAM warm-up.
\end{itemize}
These hooks are orchestrated by the \emph{SystemDK} co-design framework (policies spanning architecture, package, and OS).

\subsection{Key Technology Parameters}
Table~\ref{tab:tech_params} summarizes representative parameters used by our analysis (also reflected in Fig.~\ref{fig:access_retention_lpddr_feram}).
Values are typical-order estimates for policy exploration; silicon-specific tuning is straightforward.
