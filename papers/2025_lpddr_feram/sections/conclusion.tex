\section{Conclusion}

This work presented a practical integration path for combining LPDDR and FeRAM in mobile edge AI systems. 
By keeping LPDDR as the primary working memory and adding a small FeRAM chiplet for checkpointing and refresh suppression, 
standby power can be reduced by up to 20\%, and resume latency shortened to the $\mu$s scale. 
Unlike monolithic co-fabrication, which suffers from severe process-temperature mismatch, 
chiplet or SiP/PoP integration provides a feasible near-term solution using existing packaging technology. 

The concept generalizes to other NVM options (ReRAM, FeFET, MRAM) with the same architectural hooks, 
demonstrating the flexibility of the SystemDK co-design approach. 
Overall, LPDDR+FeRAM integration represents a concrete and immediately actionable step 
toward more energy-efficient, responsive, and persistent memory subsystems for mobile edge AI workloads.
