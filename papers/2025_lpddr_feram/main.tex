% ===== Abstract =====
\begin{abstract}
Low-power DRAM (LPDDR) is the main memory technology for mobile edge AI accelerators, providing a balance of bandwidth and energy efficiency. 
However, LPDDR still suffers from standby power due to periodic refresh and volatility. 
Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), based on HfO$_2$, offers non-volatility, low-voltage operation, and fast rewriting, making it suitable as an assistive memory for checkpointing and state retention. 
Monolithic integration of LPDDR and FeRAM is impractical due to process-temperature mismatch --- DRAM capacitor anneal $>$700$^\circ$C versus FeRAM $\sim$400$^\circ$C. 
Therefore, this work proposes \textbf{LPDDR+FeRAM integration} using chiplet or system-in-package (SiP) assembly, where LPDDR remains the main working memory and a small FeRAM die provides checkpointing and state retention. 
System-level analysis shows that FeRAM chiplets reduce standby power by suppressing DRAM refresh, shorten resume latency to the $\mu$s range, and improve overall energy efficiency for mobile edge AI workloads.
