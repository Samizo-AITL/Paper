% ===== Abstract =====
\begin{abstract}
Low-power DRAM (LPDDR) is the dominant main memory for mobile edge AI accelerators, balancing bandwidth and energy efficiency. 
However, LPDDR remains volatile and incurs standby power due to periodic refresh. 
Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), based on HfO$_2$, provides non-volatility, low-voltage operation, and fast rewriting, making it suitable as an assistive memory for checkpointing and state retention. 
Because monolithic LPDDR+FeRAM co-fabrication is infeasible due to process-temperature mismatch, this work proposes \textbf{chiplet-level LPDDR+FeRAM integration} using SiP/PoP packaging. 
System-level analysis shows that FeRAM chiplets can reduce standby power by up to 20\%, shorten resume latency from the ms to sub-ms range ($<$500~$\mu$s), and improve overall energy efficiency by 15--25\% for mobile edge AI workloads.
